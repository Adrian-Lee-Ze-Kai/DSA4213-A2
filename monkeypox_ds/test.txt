below 200 cells/µl. in moderately to severely immunocompromised patients with uncontrolled viral dissemination, optimal immune function should be prioritized. tecovirimat should be initiated promptly, and consider adding cidofovir or brincidofovir and vaccinia immune globulin. prolonged treatment may be necessary. wound care is essential, and fluid management may be required. specialist consultation should be considered as needed. close monitoring for complications is vital. 3.8. complications associated with immune system like covid-19 infection, mpox also creates cytokines inside the body. cytokines are th2-mediated, and a large number of interleukins are released, while th1-mediated cytokines are released in a lower amount. therefore, ifγ, il2, il12, tnf-α, and ifn-α levels decreased after mpox infection. the human mpox virus causes post-translational modification on the host cell. it downregulates those regulatory factors that increase histone expression while upregulating core histone proteins. the nucleosome formation of viruses depends on host nucleosome modification. mpox has a specific mechanism through which it defends itself via the immune reaction of the host. the intracellular protein of mpox called viro transducer stops apoptosis in the host cell and stops the host cell from responding against the virus. in this way, these proteins evade the host’s immune system to allow for viral replication in the host, as shown in figure 4. the mpox virus uses various strategies in the host cell to escape from the host immune defense system. innate immunity is the first line of defense and is operated by interferons. interferons prevent viral replication in host cells using direct or indirect pathways. there are three types of interferons: type 1, type 2, and type 3. ifnα, ifnβ, and ifnω are considered type i interferons. type i interferons create antiviral activity in cells by activating janus protein tyrosine kinase and signal transducers and activators of the transcription pathway. mpox virus evades the immune response of the host in the following way: an in vitro study in 2010 showed that mpox viral protein b16 inhibits jak-stat induced by type i interferon. another experiment performed in mice in 2004 found that homologs of d7l block interleukin. the complement control protein of mpox inhibits the complement activation pathway, which is a key factor for viral defense. apart from it, many proteins of mpox are responsible for evasion, including ankyrin-like protein, viral growth factor, il-18 binding protein, apoptosis inhibitors, spi-1, inhibitors of mhc class i molecules, inhibitors of irf3 nf-kb activation, inhibitor of irf3 and irf7 activation, inhibitors of mhc class ii, cc, and cxc chemokine binding proteins. 4. diagnosis of mpox pcr is a gold standard molecular biology technique that detects the presence of mpox viral dna in samples such as blood, skin lesions, or respiratory secretions. pcr is a highly sensitive and specific method used for confirmatory diagnosis. real-time pcr is the most common diagnostic procedure for the detection of mpox. in the 2022–23 outbreak of mpox, four novel molecular kits were used: the novaplex mpxv assay, the standard m10 mpx/opx, the real cycler monk-ux/monk-gx v.2, and the realstar orthopoxvirus pcr kit 1.0, with an in-house pcr assay. a comparison study of diagnostic kits shows that sensitivity and specificity were 100% for the novaplex mpxv assay and realstar orthopoxvirus pcr kit 1.0. the realcycler monk-ux/monk-gx v.2 and standard m10 mpx/opx exhibited a slight decrease in the accuracy and diagnostic sensitivity. the lab diagnosis of viral infections plays a crucial role in the detection of diseases and their treatment. cell culture or tissue culture is considered to be the standard method for the isolation and cultivation of viruses, although this method is considered to be time-consuming and has a high risk of contamination. the other standard methods for the detection of viruses are molecular and non-molecular techniques, electron microscopy-based detection, radiation-based virus detection, nucleic acid amplification methods, antigen-antibody complex-mediated detection of viruses, and crispr-cas system-based detection. urine, saliva, semen, and rectal or genital samples can also be taken for investigative purposes, depending on the clinic. crispr-based detection is also a rising diagnostic method in the field of virology. according to research conducted, a system was designed to detect the mpox viral dna using a fluorescence readout. in this study, it was shown that the g-quadruplex oligonucleotide of the target dna, which was labeled with fluorescein on the 3-prime end and black hole 1-quencher at the 5-prime end, produced a fluorescence signal when it was degraded via the cas-12a-mediated collateral cleavage. this effect was not shown in the absence of the target dna because cas-12a is unable to cleave the labeled g-quadruplex oligonucleotide, and fluorescence quenching happens. pan-orthopoxvirus pcr/esi-ms is another emerging method in the field of diagnostics; it can perform identification of all members of orthomyxovirus without sequencing by using the t5000 platform. here, a pcr method coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was employed to diagnose mpox in spiked human samples and aerosol-infected cynomolgus macaque samples. loop-mediated isothermal amplification is another molecular diagnostic technique used in virology, offering a potential alternative to rt-pcr. this technique uses the displacement of the auto-cycling step of dna synthesis by bst dna polymerase, which replicates the gene without the use of a light cycle. 5. treatment of mpox the treatment of mpox primarily focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. the symptoms, like fever, pain, and itching, can be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. antiviral medication such as tecovirimat has been used for some patients with mpox, particularly those with severe illness or who are at high risk of complications. other antiviral medications, such as brincidofovir and cidofovir, may be considered in certain situations, but their use is generally limited. vaccines are also recommended for people at high risk of exposure. to prevent infection with the mpox virus, avoid close skin contact and contact with contaminated materials. most people with mpox experience mild symptoms and recover without specific treatment. severe cases and complications are more common in individuals with weakened immune systems, children, and pregnant women. 5.1. vaccine strategies against mpox almost a thousand cases have been reported from different parts of the world since april 2022, mostly from non-endemic countries; therefore, it has become necessary to understand the possible risk factors associated with this virus. viral inactivation is a crucial step to prevent the spreading of mpox; among the methods of viral inactivation, heat inactivation is one of the methods of viral inactivation. according to batéjat christophe et al., the mpox virus was inoculated on two growth media named fcs and vtm and then subjected to heat inactivation at different temperatures over a period. this study showed that mpox got inactivated in less than 5 min if heated at 70 °c and less than 15 min if heated at 60 °c, and there was no difference between clade i and clade ii. the united states of america currently has three vaccines against smallpox: jynneostm, also known as imvamune, acam2000®, and aventis pasteur smallpox vaccine. this vaccine jynneostm has been prepared from the modified ortho poxvirus vaccinia ankara-bavarian nordic strain and is attenuated in nature and non-replicating. in august 2007, the fda approved acam2000® for the prevention of smallpox. the acam2000® vaccine is also a live vaccine but shows some differences with jynneos™. acam2000® is a replication-competent vaccinia virus, whereas jynneos™ is a replication-deficient modified vaccinia ankara virus. acam2000® shows some major cutaneous reactions, but jynneos™ does not show cutaneous reactions. under emergency use authorization, the aventis pasteur smallpox vaccine can be used, but its effectiveness against mpox is still unknown. the fda approved the use of the jynneos™ vaccine in 2019 to prevent smallpox and mpox. originally, the fda developed these vaccines for the subcutaneous route in a two-dose series. however, due to overwhelming demand, the fda issued an emergency use authorization on 9 august 2022 for the intradermal route in a two-dose series. it was also found that full vaccination with the vaccine through subcutaneous, intradermal, and heterologous routes had an adjusted ve of 88.9%, 80.3%, and 86.9%, respectively. these vaccines are administered to persons who are either suffering from mpox or have been previously exposed to such patients of mpox. these vaccines are also offered to persons who are at high risk of getting infected by mpox, such as gay, bisexual, msm, transgender, non-binary, or gender non-conforming persons and hiv patients. huber et al. have shown the effectiveness of the vaccine on patients suffering from mpox and others with msm, aged 18–49. a total of 309 infected patients were included in this study and found that the adjusted vaccine efficiency was 75.2% 61.2 to 84.2) in patients with a single dose of vaccine and 85.9% in patients with full vaccination. lauren pischel quantified the vaccine efficacy of third-generation mpox vaccines in preventing infection, hospitalization, and death among the global population. they compared vaccinated individuals to those unvaccinated or vaccinated with other vaccines. additionally, they analyzed vaccine efficacy based on the number of vaccine doses and whether the vaccine was administered as post-exposure prophylaxis. a comprehensive literature search yielded 11,892 initial records, with an additional 3223 identified through citation tracking. thirty-three studies focused on third-generation mpox vaccines, predominantly mva-bn. two additional studies reanalysed existing data. the majority of these studies cantered on gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men aged 18–49, conducted between may and october 2022. vaccine efficacy for a single dose of mva-bn was estimated at 76% across twelve studies. for two doses, the vaccine efficacy was calculated at 82% based on six studies. regarding post-exposure prophylaxis with mva-bn, the vaccine efficacy against mpox was 20% from seven studies. all vaccine efficacy estimates were derived from random-effects meta-analysis. in terms of study quality, 18 out of 33 were rated as poor, 3 out of 33 as fair, and 12 out of 33 as good. notably, studies included in the meta-analysis generally exhibited higher quality, with 11 out of 16 rated as good. 5.2. various therapies for the management of mpox 5.2.1. tecovirimat tecovirimat is generally used to treat smallpox, as recommended by the food and drug administration, but under the expanded access investigational new drug protocol, it can also be used to treat mpox. in the united states or canada, tecovirimat is not approved for use against mpox, although tecovirimat is now approved in europe for the treatment of mpox. various clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the efficacy of tecovirimat, but it is not clear. tecovirimat is a small molecule virus inhibitor with strong activity against mpox and other smallpox viruses. tecovirimat’s mechanism involves targeting the highly conserved orthopoxvirus f13l protein. this protein is essential for the creation of enveloped virions, which are necessary for viral spread. tecovirimat functions by acting as a molecular binder, promoting the dimerization of f13l and thereby inhibiting its normal activity. early studies have indicated that tecovirimat did not significantly shorten the duration of monkeypox skin lesions. initial findings from the stomp trial, which spanned multiple countries, failed to demonstrate a notable impact of tecovirimat on the healing time of skin and mucosal lesions in individuals with mild to moderate monkeypox. notably, in the stomp trial, a majority of participants began tecovirimat treatment more than five days after experiencing initial symptoms. according to another study, tecovirimat, which inhibits the formation of p37, was found to be effective in treating mpox. tecovirimat is an inhibitor of the pox virus; however, mpox also shows resistance against many drugs in cell culture, including cmx001 and st-246. the clinical study of mpox was done in france in 2022, where mpox was isolated and sequenced. this study reveals that the effective concentration of tecovirimat against mpox is in nanomolar concentrations, while cidofovir is only effective at micromolar concentrations. therefore, combination therapy may be effective for the treatment of mpox. the efficacy of tecovirimat has been evaluated in vitro and in vivo against a clade 2 canadian 2022 isolate of mpox isolated during the 2022 outbreak, and it was found that tecovirimat prevented mpox replication in vitro with an effective concentration in the nanomolar range. the efficacy of tecovirimat was also evaluated in the cast/eij mouse model with the 2022 canadian isolate. the experiments also show that tecovirimat reduced viral titers after 1–2 weeks of infection. in 2022, tecovirimat was recommended against mpox treatment. in vitro testing has been performed against 2022 canadian isolates of mpox designated mpox/sp2833. the ec50 and ec90, for tpoxx were determined against mpox/sp2833, a clade 1 virus in vero e6 cells is 0.008 ± 0.0014 ± se) and 0.0145 ± 0.0138 ± se). in a recent study published in the lancet journal in 2025, the author conducted an in vitro analysis comparing the susceptibility of clades 1b and 2b to tecovirimat. the clade 1b isolate was obtained in sweden in august 2024 from a traveler returning from africa. for comparison, the clade 2b virus was isolated in france in june 2022 from a patient at the institut pasteur medical center. additionally, ancestral clades 1a and 2a were included as controls, utilizing u2os cells, known for their high sensitivity to mpox virus infection, as target cells. the findings demonstrated that tecovirimat effectively suppressed all four viral strains, exhibiting comparable half-maximal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 15.3 nm to 25.8 nm. 5.2.2. cidofovir and brincidofovir brincidofovir and cidofovir are also being used as dna polymerase inhibitors for mpox treatment, despite not being approved by the fda. in vitro and in vivo studies reported that both cidofovir and brincidofovir can stop the replication of mpox. when brin cidofovir derivative is given to the host, the lipid part of the drug breaks down and releases cidofovir, which forms cidofovir-diphosphate after phosphorylation, which inhibits dna polymerase. in a 2020 study, another new drug was reported, which is nioch-14, having antiviral activity against mpox. 5.2.3. resveratrol a recent study indicated that resveratrol plays an important role in mpox treatment. resveratrol is a natural polyphenol found in grapes, peanuts, pines, and berries. it is also available in red and white wines, but a higher concentration is found in red wine. the maximum amount of resveratrol is found in polygonum cuspidatum. it is also known as japanese knotweed, which has been extensively used for inflammatory treatments in 2012–13. resveratrol is found in cis and trans forms, but the trans form is highly effective in anti-inflammatory activity. the antiviral effects of resveratrol have been explored in several viruses, including the mpox virus, the influenza a virus epstein–barr virus, herpes simplex virus, hiv, and hepatitis c virus. resveratrol inhibits the replication of many viruses. the antiviral mechanisms of resveratrol against various types of viruses are different. resveratrol reduced the virus yield by more than 120-fold at a concentration of 50 mm. the effect of resveratrol against mpox has also been examined using hela cells. hela cells were infected with two strains of mpox virus, mpox-wa and mpox-roc, and it was found that resveratrol at 50 mm concentration reduced the yield of mpox-wa and mpox-roc clades by 195- and 38-fold, respectively. apart from these potential therapies, some other alternative treatments such as top1 inhibitor, chlorhexidine, and cysteine proteinase inhibitors are being explored, but more investigation is required for the effective treatment of these compounds. 5.2.4. plant metabolite as a therapeutic drug a recent study was conducted in 2023, in which the anti-monkeypox capability was evaluated in 56 plant products. among these metabolites, curcumin showed the strongest binding affinity with a value of −37.43 kcal/mol, followed by gedunin, piperine, and coumadin. the study that occurred in 2022 shows various natural compounds obtained from plantago lanceolate targeting on profilin-like protein a42r of mpox virus. the a42r protein of mpox has an amino acid sequence similarity with profilin proteins of eukaryotic cells. profilin family proteins are actin-binding proteins responsible for f-actin assembly in the actin filament and also participate in the regulation of f-actin. silico-based screening identified various important compounds, such as luteolin 7,30-diglucuronide, luteolin 7-glucuronide-30-glucoside, plantagoside, narcissoside, and others. the molecular dynamics simulation and post-simulation analysis revealed that plantagoside and narcissoside were found to be more stable products that were able to bind with the binding pocket of the viral protein of the mpox virus due to hydrophobic and hydrogen interactions. 6. conclusions mpox, while historically less prevalent than other orthopoxviruses, has demonstrated a significant emergence for globally, highlighting the importance of robust surveillance and preparedness. its complications, while often self-limiting, can be severe, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and children. transmission, primarily through close contact, necessitates stringent public health measures to curtail outbreaks. accurate and timely diagnosis, facilitated by pcr testing, is crucial for effective management and containment. while specific antiviral treatments are available, their accessibility and widespread use remain limited, emphasizing the need for further research and development. effective public health strategies, including vaccination and education, are essential in mitigating the impact of mpox and preventing future pandemics. continued research into the virus’s evolving epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and optimal treatment strategies is imperative to safeguard global health. the 2019 coronavirus pandemic demonstrated that disease outbreaks extend beyond physical illness, significantly affecting mental well-being. individuals experienced heightened fear, including anxiety about potential loss and depression linked to isolation. healthcare workers facing direct exposure reported particularly elevated levels of fear. parallels can be drawn with the mpox outbreak, which has also been associated with notable economic and behavioral shifts, manifesting in increased anger, frustration, depression, and anxiety. the health care provider also has very little knowledge regarding the treatment of mpox, so proper guidance and care of mpox-affected people should be done for the management of mental health issues in covid-19-affected people, who issued advisories that may be implemented in mpox cases. the important suggestions to control mental disorders during the monkeypox outbreak are as follows: always study and gain knowledge from an authorized source, such as who. do not come under the influence of people who are already suffering from any mental disorder because of an outbreak. avoid drinking alcohol or smoking during an outbreak because it will only ruin your health condition. hand hygiene practices should be followed regularly. eat a well-balanced diet, and try to avoid sitting alone. even when you are alone in the house, try to chat with your friends or family members via social media. exercise daily. the outbreaks in 2022 across the globe have emphasized the significance of continuous and focused intensive care, along with the development of novel drugs. the limited smallpox vaccine administration and decreasing immunity in the population can enhance virus spreading globally. patients of mpox have different kinds of complications, such as bacterial infection of the skin, skin scarring, permanent corneal scarring, pneumonia, dehydration, sepsis, and encephalitis. it is imperative to provide comprehensive care for patients, including education, nutritional support, hydration, and protection of sensitive organs such as the eyes and genitals. therefore, it is important for the medical professional team, including clinicians, health experts, and nurses, to immediately identify infection in humans and animals, use protective measures, and initiate public health reporting to prevent an outbreak.
mpox virus: virology, molecular epidemiology, and global public health challenges abstract monkeypox, a zoonotic disease caused by the mpox virus, has re-emerged as a significant global health concern, particularly since the 2022 outbreaks in non-endemic countries. mpxv shares close virological and genetic similarities with other orthopoxviruses, notably variola virus. the current circulating strains, primarily of clade iib, exhibit enhanced human-to-human transmissibility. this review synthesizes recent advances in mpxv virology, pathogenesis, molecular evolution, clinical features, and diagnostic techniques. in addition, we highlight the mounting public health challenges, including vaccine inequity, immunity gaps in the post-smallpox era, surveillance limitations, healthcare system vulnerabilities, and stigma-related barriers to disease reporting and control. addressing these multifaceted issues requires a globally coordinated response integrating equitable vaccine access, strengthened surveillance, stigma-free health education, and harmonized outbreak response strategies. a comprehensive understanding of these factors is critical to preventing future large-scale outbreaks and mitigating the global health burden posed by mpxv. virological characteristics of mpxv mpxv belongs to the orthopoxvirus genus within the poxviridae family. it is an enveloped linear double-stranded dna virus, approximately 200–250 nm in size, appearing as oval or brick-shaped particles under electron microscopy, surrounded by a lipoprotein membrane. the virus structure is composed of three main parts: the core, which contains the viral genome; the lateral bodies located on either side of the core; and the outer protein envelope. although mpxv is a dna virus, it primarily replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells, encoding proteins that promote viral genome replication and gene expression. during its replication cycle, mpxv produces four distinct types of viral particles: intracellular mature virus, intracellular enveloped virus, cell-associated enveloped virus, and extracellular enveloped virus. among these, imv and eev are the primary infectious forms. the viral particles enter host cells through binding and fusion with the host cell membrane, after which they release pre-packaged viral proteins and enzymes into the cytoplasm, suppressing the host immune defense system and initiating early viral gene expression. the virus then undergoes dna replication, transcription, and translation to complete its life cycle. mature imv can be released externally through cell lysis or by forming eev via fusion with the golgi apparatus and cytoplasmic membrane. eev has two main release pathways: transported along microtubules to the cell membrane, followed by exocytosis; directly released into the external environment through interactions with actin. these distinct release mechanisms enable mpxv to efficiently spread within the host and accelerate its transmission in human populations. mpxv, like variola virus, cowpox viruses, and vaccinia virus, belongs to the orthopoxvirus genus and is one of the largest dna viruses found in mammals. phylogenetic analyses suggest that mpxv originated approximately 600 years ago in west africa. genetic studies show that these four poxviruses share a common ancestor and have highly similar dna sequences. immunologically, these viruses exhibit cross-antigenicity, meaning infection with one of these viruses can provide some degree of protection against the other three. in their study on orthopoxviruses, shchelkunov et al. compared the amino acid sequences of mpxv and varv, finding that the central genomic region of the two viruses has an amino acid sequence similarity of up to 96%, while the terminal regions show 83.5–93.6% amino acid similarity, indicating a close evolutionary relationship between mpxv and varv. additionally, research on the vaccinia virus tian tan strain demonstrated that vacv and mpxv are structurally highly similar, with 90% homology in their dna sequences, and they maintain this high degree of conservation during viral replication. notably, vacv proteins a27l, l1r, d8l, b5r, and a33r show significant homology with mpxv proteins a29l, l1r, e8l, b6r, and a35r, respectively. it is known that the varv was one of the earliest poxviruses to cause disease in humans and is one of the most lethal orthopoxviruses. in the 17th century, people developed the practice of “variolation” which involved grinding the scabs from smallpox patients into a powder and blowing it into the nostrils of uninfected individuals to provide immunity against smallpox. however, the mortality rate from this method was approximately 2%, presenting a significant risk. in the 18th century, to reduce the mortality associated with smallpox inoculation, dr. edward jenner used pus from cowpox lesions to inoculate a boy. although the boy developed mild symptoms, he fully recovered within a few weeks and did not contract smallpox when subsequently exposed to the virus. jenner’s cowpox vaccination successfully provided protection against smallpox. due to the cowpox vaccine being much safer than variolation, it quickly became the primary method for smallpox prevention. over time, it was discovered that the vacv vaccine not only provided better protection against smallpox but was also safer. as a result, vacv gradually replaced cpxv as the primary vehicle for the smallpox vaccine. the vacv-based smallpox vaccine significantly reduced the risks associated with vaccination and played a crucial role in the global eradication of smallpox. in 1980, the world health organization declared smallpox eradicated, after which china and other countries ceased smallpox vaccination. consequently, individuals born after 1980 lack vaccine-induced immunity and are more susceptible to mpxv. studies indicate that the vacv-based smallpox vaccine offers approximately 85% protection against mpxv. mpxv can be cultured in various cell lines, including rhesus monkey kidney cells and mouse liver cells. after inoculation with mpxv, its characteristic cytopathic effect and plaque formation can be observed, with plaque size being a distinguishing feature between mpxv and varv. mpxv exhibits strong survival capabilities in vitro, showing good tolerance to drying and low temperatures, but it is sensitive to high temperatures. on contaminated surfaces, mpxv can survive for several months in cold environments, but heating at 56°c for 30 min or 60°c for 10 min can inactivate the virus. mpxv is sensitive to common disinfectants and ultraviolet radiation, and it can be effectively inactivated by disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite, glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, and paraformaldehyde. pathogenic mechanisms of mpxv the mpxv genome is relatively large, approximately 197,000 base pairs, encoding 190 open reading frames and comprising over 200 genes. the mpxv genome is divided into three main sections: a central region encoding essential enzymes and structural proteins required for viral dna replication, transcription, and assembly; and two flanking regions containing inverted terminal repeats, which are primarily involved in virus-host interactions, immune evasion, and apoptosis signaling. current research on mpxv focuses on immunogenic proteins, such as a33r, a37r, b4r, and b5r proteins. the a33r protein facilitates the binding of the virus to host target cells. the a37r protein, homologous to the a35r protein in cpxv, may play a role in modulating the expression of mhc class ii molecules on the surface of host antigen-presenting cells. this function has been observed in cpxv’s a35r protein, and mpxv’s a37r protein is hypothesized to exhibit similar activity. the b4r and b5r proteins of mpxv have multiple functions, including inhibiting host cell proliferation, regulating hematopoiesis, modulating immune responses, and participating in host cell adhesion, signaling, and mrna transcription. understanding the structure and function of these viral proteins is crucial for addressing genetic changes that arise during periods of high viral transmission and for studying the virus-host immune system interactions. this knowledge also provides essential insights for developing new mpxv vaccines that can offer immunity against different viral strains and that are suitable for large-scale production. the pathogenic mechanisms of mpxv are similar to other orthopoxviruses, such as varv and vacv, in that mpxv is capable of infecting a variety of mammalian cells and is highly transmissible. mpxv’s initial infection targets primarily the oral cavity and respiratory tract, with an initial asymptomatic phase. the virus then migrates by infecting nearby immune cells and spreads from the primary infection site to adjacent draining lymph nodes. the infected immune cells may include monocytes, macrophages, b cells, and dendritic cells. there is debate regarding the early dissemination mechanisms of orthopoxviruses. for instance, in cpxv-infected mice, viral dissemination occurs through dendritic cells, transferring the virus from the pulmonary epithelium to the draining lymph nodes. in contrast, vacv infection of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells impairs their maturation and migration potential, allowing the virus to evade immune responses, suggesting that vacv may not rely on dendritic cells for viral spread. in 1969, wenner et al. studied the pathogenesis of mpxv by inoculating cynomolgus monkeys with the virus. they found that mpxv proliferated within cells at the injection site, accompanied by a local inflammatory response, including cell necrosis and vasculitis. mpxv was also detected in the lymph nodes and blood vessels, indicating that the virus spreads through lymphatic and blood pathways. mpxv reaches the lymphoid tissues in the neck and throat via draining lymph nodes, where it replicates, leading to viremia. subsequently, the virus further disseminates through the bloodstream to the liver and spleen. studies have shown that the liver and spleen are major targets for mpxv replication and dissemination. in these organs, viral infection exacerbates viremia, enabling further spread to the lungs, kidneys, and skin, which leads to various clinical symptoms in the host. in the early stages of mpxv infection, eev viral particles interact with the primary attachment receptors on the host cell membrane—glycosaminoglycans —via their surface proteins to enter the host cell. the specific host cell surface receptors and their associated proteins are not yet fully understood, but three mpxv-encoded proteins have been identified as being involved in viral entry. the first is the e8l protein, which can bind to chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans on the host cell surface, mediating the adsorption of imv to host cells. the second is the l1 protein, a viral envelope protein. studies on the pathogenesis of vacv have shown that the l1 protein is a key factor in the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane and is part of the entry/fusion complex. the l1 protein of mpxv shares high homology with that of vacv and likely plays a similar role in mpxv invasion of host cells, although this mechanism requires further investigation. the third is the h3l envelope protein, which has been found to play an important role in viral adsorption to host cells and the formation of imv in studies of varv. in addition, mpxv evades the host immune system through multiple mechanisms during human infection. the virus can escape detection by host pattern recognition receptors that sense rna, suppress ifn-mediated antiviral responses, control the apoptosis of infected cells, and limit the host’s inflammatory response. these mechanisms enhance viral replication capacity, creating a microenvironment conducive to viral replication, infection, and transmission. mpxv epidemiology since the eradication of smallpox in the 1980s, orthopoxviruses had largely faded from public attention. however, with the global outbreak of mpxv, this virus and other orthopoxviruses have returned to the spotlight. mpox, a zoonotic disease caused by mpxv, was first identified in 1958 in a laboratory in copenhagen, denmark, where a smallpox-like disease was observed in captive cynomolgus monkeys, giving rise to the name “monkeypox”. in 1970, mpxv was first isolated from a suspected smallpox patient in the democratic republic of the congo. between 1971 and 1978, 47 confirmed mpox cases were recorded, the majority of which were in central and west africa, with 38 cases in the drc. the remaining nine cases occurred in cameroon, the central african republic, gabon, côte d’ivoire, liberia, nigeria, and sierra leone. in may 2003, the first outbreak of mpxv outside of africa occurred in the united states, with 72 suspected cases reported, of which 47 were confirmed in the laboratory. an investigation by the centers for disease control and prevention linked this outbreak to prairie dogs imported from africa. from 2017 to 2018, nigeria experienced a large-scale mpox outbreak, with cases spreading to non-endemic countries. in 2019, singapore reported the first imported case of mpox in asia. before 2022, although a few non-endemic countries reported sporadic mpox cases, these cases were relatively infrequent compared to those occurring in africa during the same period. on may 16, 2022, the united kingdom reported its first imported case of mpox from nigeria. subsequently, other non-endemic countries, including spain, portugal, sweden, canada, and australia, also reported cases. by the end of may 2025, 133 countries and regions had reported a total of 150,069 mpox cases to the world health organization, including 328 deaths, confirming that the mpox outbreak is gradually becoming globalized. on july 23, 2022, the who declared the mpox outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern ” and assessed the risk level as moderate. from january 2022 to may 2025, europe and americas reported a total of 99,432 confirmed mpox cases, far exceeding the 42,829 cases reported in africa. the top five regions reporting mpox cases globally were the americas, africa, europe, the western pacific, and southeast asia. the first imported case of mpox in china was reported in taiwan in june 2022. in september of the same year, hong kong and chongqing also reported their first imported cases, followed by multiple provinces reporting mpox infections. this mpox outbreak spread rapidly and widely, with many cases lacking travel histories to central or west africa, becoming a significant public health concern and attracting heightened attention from various countries and the who. genomic sequencing studies indicate that mpxv has two main evolutionary branches: type i and type ii, both of which represent strains that initially infected humans. as mpxv continues to evolve, these branches have further diversified. the west african branch is divided into two sub-branches, iia and iib, with the iib sub-branch further subdivided into multiple lineages, including a.1, a.1.1, a.2, b.1, and b.1.1. the strains responsible for the nigerian outbreak in 2017–2018 were primarily of the a.2 lineage, while the imported strains reported in singapore, the uk, the usa, and israel from 2018 to 2021 were mainly of the a.1 lineage. the strains associated with the 2022 outbreak were predominantly of the b.1 lineage and its branches. research indicates that strains from branch i exhibit stronger virulence and transmissibility, with an average mortality rate of up to 10.6%. in contrast, strains from branch ii show lower virulence and transmissibility, with an average mortality rate of approximately 3.6%. geographically, branch i strains are primarily prevalent in regions such as the congo, cameroon, and sudan in africa, whereas branch ii strains have spread across the continent, leading to intercontinental transmission and resulting in mpox outbreaks in non-endemic countries like the united states and the united kingdom. some researchers have conducted genomic comparisons between the b.1 lineage strains found in non-endemic countries like the united states and germany in 2022 and the mpxv strains circulating in nigeria from 2017 to 2019. they discovered approximately 50 single nucleotide polymorphism sites of difference, with an snp mutation rate more than six times that of other poxviruses, suggesting that the b.1 strain has a higher mutation rate and evolutionary speed. from the mpxv strains first identified in 1970 to the currently circulating strains, evolution has primarily manifested at the genetic level. mpxv continuously evolves through mechanisms such as point mutations, gene deletions, and recombination. for instance, the virus utilizes the host’s apolipoprotein b mrna-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 cytidine deaminase to induce conversions of cytosines to uracils in foreign dna during the viral replication process, leading to point mutations that facilitate the formation of new lineages. epidemiological studies demonstrate that the virulence of mpxv varies across different evolutionary branches. the median lethal dose of the west african branch is 1.29 × 105 pfu per animal, while that of the central african branch is 5.9 × 103 pfu per animal, indicating higher virulence in the central african branch. in animal experiments, prairie dogs inoculated with different doses of the central african strain exhibited high morbidity and mortality rates, whereas those inoculated with the west african strain survived with minimal disease symptoms, providing experimental evidence for the differences in virulence between the two branches. at the genomic level, the nucleotide sequence similarity between the central african and west african branches is 99.5%, while the amino acid sequence similarity is 99.4%. the most significant genetic differences between the two branches are observed in the br-203, br-209, and cop-c3l genes. br-203 is a homolog of the myxoma virus m-t4 gene, which encodes a 221 amino acid protein. during myxv infection, m-t4 primarily resides in the endoplasmic reticulum, enhancing viral virulence and inhibiting apoptosis in infected cells. in mpxv branch i, br-203 encodes the full 221 amino acid protein; however, due to two base pair deletions in branch ii, it only encodes an n-terminal fragment of approximately 51 amino acids, leading to premature termination of translation and weakening the gene’s functionality. the br-209 gene encodes a 326 amino acid protein that functions as an il-1β-binding protein, preventing il-1β from binding to its receptor and inhibiting the inflammatory response. in mpxv branch i, the br-209 gene encodes a complete protein consisting of an n-terminal 210 amino acids and a c-terminal 126 amino acids. in branch ii, a single base insertion near the n-terminal and a four-base deletion result in the encoding of only a fragment comprising an n-terminal 163 amino acids and a c-terminal 132 amino acids. it remains unclear whether this difference in n-terminal length is related to the virulence differences between the central and west african branches and requires further investigation. the cop-c3l gene encodes a 263 amino acid complement control protein, referred to in mpxv as the mpox complement inhibitor, which encodes a protein of 216 amino acids. this protein inhibits the complement pathway through a mechanism similar to mammalian complement activation regulators. although the complement control protein of mpxv has some base pair deletions, it still retains certain complement inhibitory functions. however, the cop-c3l gene is not expressed in branch ii, which may be one of the reasons for the differences in virulence between the two branches. research has shown that integrating mopice into branch ii did not fully elevate its virulence to that of branch i, but it altered the disease manifestation and accelerated disease progression. mpxv primarily spreads through rodent species such as gambian pouched rats and dormice, with humans and monkeys acting as incidental hosts; therefore, this virus is classified as a zoonotic disease. the transmission of mpxv occurs through two main routes: animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission. animal-to-human transmission occurs through direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids, or lesions of infected animals. human-to-human transmission primarily happens through contact with lesions, scabs, saliva, or other bodily fluids from infected individuals, as well as through contact with contaminated objects, such as clothing or towels that have not been disinfected. although mpxv is not a typical sexually transmitted disease, viral dna has been detected in semen, indicating its potential for sexual transmission. in the context of modern open societal environments, the risk of sexual transmission of mpxv may heighten public awareness of sexually transmitted diseases, thereby reducing the occurrence of high-risk sexual behaviors. additionally, mpxv can be transmitted vertically to the fetus through the placenta during pregnancy and can also be transmitted to newborns during or after delivery through close contact. a study conducted in the democratic republic of the congo reported four pregnant women infected with mpxv, with only one newborn being born healthy. while vaccination against smallpox is not recommended for pregnant women, infants in regions where mpox is endemic should receive the smallpox vaccine promptly to prevent infection. further research is needed to assess the potential impact of mpxv on pregnant women and appropriate response measures. epidemiological reports indicate that past mpox cases have primarily occurred in children and adolescents. from 1970 to 1989, the majority of mpox infections in africa were among children, with a median age of infection of 4 years. in contrast, during the periods of 2000–2009 and 2010–2019, the median age of infection increased to 10 years and 21 years, respectively, indicating a gradual rise in the age of onset over time. by 2022, during the mpox outbreak in non-endemic countries, 79% of cases occurred in adult males aged 18 to 44, with a median age of 36 years. this shift may be related to the interruption of smallpox vaccination programs. the smallpox vaccine provides up to 85% cross-protection against mpxv; however, since smallpox was declared eradicated in the 1980s, vaccination ceased for individuals born after 1980, resulting in increased susceptibility to mpxv among these populations. additionally, studies have shown that the infection rates of mpxv are similar between males and females. however, during the mpox outbreaks in 2022, many cases were concentrated within the men who have sex with men community. reports from the centers for disease control and prevention indicated that the majority of mpox cases in the 2022 outbreak were among gay men, significantly increasing the infection risk for specific populations, including homosexuals, bisexuals, and transgender individuals. the immune function of mpox -infected individuals is correlated with the severity of mpxv infection. research has shown that hiv-positive individuals exhibit more pronounced symptoms after mpxv infection, including rashes, fever, genital ulcers, inguinal lymphadenopathy, and necrotic lesions in the perianal area, genitals, oral cavity, trunk, and face. during the mpxv outbreak in nigeria from 2017 to 2018, more than half of mpox -related deaths occurred in patients co-infected with hiv. co-infection with hiv and mpxv leads to prolonged disease courses, more severe lesions, difficulties in healing, and a higher incidence of secondary bacterial infections and genital ulcers. a recent report documented cases of hiv-positive individuals co-infected with mpxv and syphilis, exhibiting extremely severe symptoms, including systemic mpox manifestations along with necrosis of the nose and severe infections of the penis and oral mucosa. therefore, individuals who are unvaccinated, engage in high-risk sexual behaviors, have compromised immune systems, are elderly, or are children should be prioritized for protection against mpxv infection. currently, the predominant mpxv strains circulating globally are derived from the b.1 lineage, which is a micro-evolutionary branch of the iib clade. this lineage is characterized by an enhanced adaptability to humans during its evolution, exhibiting stronger transmissibility but lower pathogenicity, with a mortality rate of less than 1%. epidemiological investigations have indicated that, since the cessation of smallpox vaccination, global immunity to orthopoxviruses has gradually declined, as evidenced by the increasing median age of mpox cases. early mpxv infections were primarily confined to central and west africa, with sporadic cases occurring in other continents, though their impact was minimal. with the acceleration of globalization, the mpox outbreak in 2022 demonstrated that mpxv has acquired new genetic mutations during its prolonged evolutionary process, leading to a significant increase in cases among individuals with no travel history to endemic regions. this indicates that mpxv has the potential to continue evolving and could trigger large-scale outbreaks similar to smallpox. therefore, countries urgently need to implement existing preventive measures to actively curb the spread of mpox. clinical manifestations of mpox mpxv infection presents similarly to varv and is classified as a self-limiting disease. after infection, mpxv enters the host through various transmission routes and has an incubation period of 5 to 21 days. upon completion of the incubation period, patients typically exhibit signs akin to those of viral infections, including fever, headache, lymphadenopathy, chills, fatigue, lethargy, and myalgia. after 1 to 3 days of fever, a rash usually begins to appear, starting on the face and then spreading to the trunk and limbs, forming large rashes that can number from a few to thousands. the evolution of the rash includes macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, and finally crusting and desquamation. the course of the disease typically lasts 2 to 4 weeks, after which the lesions generally heal, leaving atrophic scars. in certain severe cases, complications may arise, including conjunctivitis, corneal infections, encephalitis, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, bronchopneumonia, syphilis, gonorrhea, herpes simplex, and genital chlamydia infections. prior to 2022, among the circulating mpxv strains, male patients accounted for approximately 55%, slightly more than female patients. the rash was predominantly located on the head and neck, trunk, limbs, and genital region, usually exhibiting a centrifugal distribution and can be widespread. although it has been reported that approximately 99% of cases during the 2022 mpox outbreak occurred in male patients, another study has indicated a substantial proportion of cases among women as well, accounting for 17.22% of infections. overall, the 2022 mpox outbreak disproportionately affected men compared to women. the incubation period was shorter, and rashes were primarily distributed in the genital area, perianal area, trunk, limbs, and head and neck, with the perianal and genital regions often being the initial sites of rash development. furthermore, in the 2022 mpox cases, about half of the patients’ rashes did not follow the typical progression, potentially skipping one or more rash stages. most patients had fewer than 10 rashes, with 10% of patients presenting with only one rash. the rash at the initial site frequently appeared as a “doughnut-like” pseudopustule, characterized by raised edges and a central dimple. patients with compromised immune function, such as those infected with hiv or those with other immunosuppressive conditions, tended to have larger lesions with deeper inflammation, which could result in wart-like plaques or large ulcers, prolonged healing times, and significant scarring. in this outbreak, traditional prodromal symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and headache were milder and even absent, with these symptoms appearing not only before the rash but also during or after its onset. lymphadenopathy also presented differently; while systemic lymphadenopathy was common in previous outbreaks, in this outbreak, it was often limited to one or two sites associated with the rash, and the swollen lymph nodes shifted from the cervical region to the groin. additionally, patients who engaged in anal intercourse may exhibit rectal involvement, presenting with symptoms such as rectal-perianal pain, hematochezia, diarrhea, and tenesmus. in severe cases, ulcerative lesions may develop near the intestinal mucosa, leading to intestinal perforation. due to inflammation potentially involving all layers of the skin, rashes often accompanied by edema could lead to significant swelling of the penis and scrotum when lesions appear in the male genital area. in severe cases, multiple rashes may coalesce, potentially affecting the urethra, leading to urinary difficulties and hematuria, which may require surgical intervention. diagnostic techniques for mpox due to the extremely similar clinical presentations caused by different orthopoxviruses, it is challenging to diagnose mpox solely based on infection symptoms. therefore, diagnostic techniques with high sensitivity and rapid detection rates are crucial for controlling outbreaks. currently, polymerase chain reaction and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction are the conventional methods of choice for detecting suspected mpxv infections. samples of vesicular exudate and scab material are typically used to confirm mpxv infection. in pcr, mpxv is specifically identified by detecting an 8-bp deletion in the gene encoding the a-type inclusions protein. real-time pcr selects the conserved regions of the b6r, e9l, c3l, f3l, and n3r genes as amplification targets. other techniques, such as isothermal amplification, are efficient and rapid but may produce non-specific amplification, necessitating precise primer design; these methods are still under investigation. virus isolation and culture are classical diagnostic methods, with mpxv growing well in cell lines such as hela and vero, as well as in chick embryos. however, isolating and culturing mpxv must be performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory or higher, and should be conducted by experienced personnel. despite the implementation of comprehensive personal protective measures, there remains a risk of infection. electron microscopy can identify viral particles in rashes, vesicles, and scabs. however, these particles appear similar to those of other orthopoxviruses under the microscope, indicating only that the virus belongs to the orthopoxvirus genus and not specifying the exact species. moreover, electron microscopy requires a high level of knowledge from the operator, and there are certain infection risks associated with the sample preparation process. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay can detect specific igm and igg antibodies in the serum of mpox patients 1 to 4 weeks after the appearance of rashes. however, due to its lower specificity, it is susceptible to interference from cross-reactivity with other orthopoxviruses. treatment and prognosis of mpox during the 2003 mpox outbreak in the united states, the cdc suggested that administration of the smallpox vaccine within 2 weeks of infection might alleviate disease severity. however, the vaccine was neither made publicly available nor routinely used in mpox patients. this was largely due to high production costs relative to the limited number of cases, as well as concerns over safety. live smallpox vaccines have been associated with serious adverse events in vulnerable populations, including cryptococcal meningitis, myocarditis, pneumonia, vision loss, and complications during pregnancy. for severe mpox cases, more intensive interventions may be required. these include cross-protective vaccines such as acam2000, jynneos, and vaccinia immune globulin intravenous, along with antiviral agents developed for smallpox—namely tecovirimat, cidofovir, and brincidofovir. currently, effective antiviral therapies specifically approved for the clinical treatment of mpox remain limited. as a result, antiviral agents originally developed and stockpiled for smallpox—such as tecovirimat, cidofovir, and brincidofovir—are currently being repurposed for mpox management under the protocols of the u.s. strategic national stockpile. tecovirimat, a small-molecule inhibitor targeting the vp37 protein on the surface of orthopoxviruses, is the first-line treatment for patients with severe or high-risk disease—such as immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, and children. it is available under an expanded-access investigational new drug protocol. although randomized trials have demonstrated tecovirimat’s safety, they have not shown a significant reduction in lesion healing time. in cases of progressive disease, treatment failure, or suspected resistance, combination therapy with brincidofovir or intravenous cidofovir is recommended, both accessible through emergency-use frameworks. cidofovir, a nucleotide analog inhibiting viral dna polymerase, has demonstrated efficacy in vitro and in animal models but is limited in clinical use due to its nephrotoxicity. brincidofovir, a lipid-conjugated derivative of cidofovir approved in 2021 for smallpox, offers improved oral bioavailability and intracellular activation. it has shown survival benefit in preclinical models, although clinical data in mpox remain sparse. its adverse effects—including gastrointestinal disturbances and transient elevations in liver enzymes—necessitate careful monitoring during treatment. while it is better tolerated than cidofovir, brincidofovir has a less favorable safety profile than tecovirimat. vaccinia immune globulin may be considered for immunocompromised individuals or those with ocular involvement, although its effectiveness in mpox is not yet well established. treatment decisions should be tailored to individual clinical scenarios and guided by cdc recommendations, especially in light of emerging antiviral resistance and the complexity of severe cases. mpox is generally a self-limiting disease, with most immunocompetent patients recovering within two to four weeks. supportive care remains the cornerstone of management and includes antipyretics, analgesics, fluid and electrolyte balance, skin hygiene to prevent secondary infections, and antibiotics when indicated. however, in vulnerable populations—such as young children, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, and persons living with hiv—mpox can progress to severe or even fatal outcomes. prognosis in these groups hinges on prompt antiviral therapy and comprehensive supportive measures. despite progress in therapeutic options, several key challenges remain. first, high-quality randomized controlled trials are lacking, and current treatment recommendations are based primarily on observational data or preclinical studies. second, viral evolution—particularly mutations in genes encoding vp37 or dna polymerase—may reduce drug sensitivity. third, access to antiviral agents remains uneven, especially in endemic and resource-limited regions, further exacerbating global health disparities. to overcome these limitations, ongoing research is exploring innovative approaches, including host-directed therapies, immunomodulatory drugs, and mpxv-specific monoclonal antibodies. well-designed multicenter clinical trials and longitudinal cohort studies are urgently needed to determine treatment efficacy and establish standardized, evidence-based protocols for diverse patient populations. public health challenges of the mpox outbreak since the global resurgence of mpox in 2022, the disease has posed significant challenges to public health systems worldwide. these challenges are multifaceted, encompassing issues of vaccine equity, disease surveillance, public communication, healthcare infrastructure, and international policy coordination. understanding these challenges is critical to preventing future large-scale outbreaks and mitigating the public health burden of mpox. the cessation of smallpox vaccination after the disease’s eradication in 1980 has left a vast proportion of the global population without immunity to orthopoxviruses, including mpxv. this immunity gap is particularly evident in individuals born after 1980, who now constitute the majority of the global adult population. although vaccines such as jynneos and acam2000 are available, access remains heavily skewed toward high-income countries. in contrast, many low- and middle-income countries, including those in africa where mpox is endemic, face considerable barriers to vaccine acquisition, including supply chain limitations, financial constraints, and regulatory delays. this inequitable distribution undermines global containment efforts and exacerbates the vulnerability of high-risk populations. the 2022 outbreak revealed a disproportionate impact on men who have sex with men. while this has important epidemiological implications, it has also led to stigma and misinformation that hindered case reporting, contact tracing, and access to healthcare. in some regions, individuals avoided testing or treatment due to fear of discrimination. public health messaging that is inclusive, nonjudgmental, and culturally sensitive is essential to address this issue. furthermore, overemphasis on msm populations risks obscuring other transmission routes and susceptible groups, potentially leading to incomplete surveillance. accurate and timely surveillance is a cornerstone of epidemic response. however, mpox surveillance is still fragmented globally. many endemic regions lack robust infrastructure for genomic sequencing, contact tracing, and rapid diagnostics. even in non-endemic countries, the initial response to the 2022 outbreak was delayed due to a lack of familiarity with the disease and insufficient diagnostic capacity. strengthening surveillance systems and integrating mpox testing into broader infectious disease platforms are crucial for early detection and containment. many health systems, particularly in resource-constrained settings, are ill-equipped to manage additional outbreaks such as mpox. during the covid-19 pandemic, healthcare personnel and facilities were already strained, and the emergence of mpox added further pressure. this is especially concerning in contexts with limited isolation wards, inadequate training on poxvirus infection control, and insufficient stockpiles of personal protective equipment and antivirals. integrating mpox preparedness into broader epidemic response frameworks is essential to building resilience. although the world health organization declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern in 2022, international responses were inconsistent. some countries instituted aggressive contact tracing and ring vaccination programs, while others delayed action or downplayed the threat. this lack of coordinated strategy reflects a broader challenge in global health governance—ensuring timely, equitable, and science-based responses across geopolitical boundaries. future frameworks must emphasize international collaboration, resource sharing, and equitable policy implementation. conclusion although mpxv was first identified decades ago, its recent global resurgence—particularly since 2022—marks a new phase in its epidemiological significance. genetic evolution, increased human-to-human transmissibility, and the absence of population-wide smallpox vaccination have contributed to widespread susceptibility. our review highlights critical findings in mpxv virology, pathogenic mechanisms, and diagnostic tools, which are essential for guiding clinical and scientific responses. however, beyond biomedical understanding, the current outbreak underscores profound public health challenges. the lack of equitable access to vaccines, persistent surveillance and diagnostic gaps, health system limitations in resource-poor settings, and social stigma—especially affecting msm populations—have collectively hindered effective outbreak control. moreover, fragmented international responses point to the urgent need for coordinated global strategies. going forward, successful containment of mpox will depend not only on scientific innovation but also on inclusive public health policies, international cooperation, and investment in pandemic preparedness infrastructure. a unified, equity-centered approach is essential to ensure that mpxv does not evolve into a persistent and preventable global health threat.
current insights into diagnosis, prevention strategies, treatment, therapeutic targets, and challenges of monkeypox infections in human populations abstract in the wake of the emergence and worldwide respread of a viral infection called monkeypox, there is a serious threat to the health and safety of the global population. this viral infection was endemic to the western and central parts of africa, but has recently spread out of this endemic area to various countries, including the united kingdom, portugal, spain, the united states of america, canada, sweden, belgium, italy, australia, germany, france, the netherlands, israel, and mexico. this is a timely review focusing on recent findings and developments in the epidemiology, clinical features, therapeutic targets, diagnosis, prevention mechanisms, research challenges and possible treatment for mpox. to date, there have been around 81,225 reported cases of mpox. in most cases, this illness is mild; however, there is a fatality rate ranging from 1 to 10%, which might be increased due to associated complications and/or secondary infections. there is a real challenge in the diagnosis of mpox, since its symptoms are very similar to those of other infections, including smallpox and chickenpox. generally, to prevent/limit the risk and transmission of mpox, the detection and isolation of infected individuals, as well as hand hygiene and cleanliness, are essential and effective approaches to control/combat this viral infection. nevertheless, updated information about mpox from different angles is lacking. thus, this review provides updated and comprehensive information about the mpox illness, which should highlight the global burden, pathogenicity, symptoms, diagnosis, prevention measures and possible treatment of this emerging disease. 1. introduction monkeypox virus is a double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid virus, causing mpox illness in humans and other animals, that is rapidly spreading worldwide. on 29 november 2022, around 81,225 cases of mpox were confirmed and/or suspected from about 111 countries. in addition to the world’s continued fight against the coronavirus disease pandemic, this recently emerging disease has added another global burden to worldwide health. as an added advantage, unlike covid-19, which was detected during the early part of 2020, scientists have gained a great deal of insight into mpox in the past few years. nevertheless, detailed and up-to-date information about mpox is very limited, and the future outcome of this viral infection is not extensively discussed. therefore, this review focuses on the mpox illness in terms of prevalence, transmission and pathogenicity, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approaches, prevention measures, and possible treatment or/and vaccination. 2. survey methodology various scientific search engines, such as sciencedirect, pubmed, scopus, google scholar and medline were used to search and retrieve related published papers/literature about mpox since 1958. the keywords/phrases/sentences that were used to search for relevant papers/literatures/data related to mpox infection in order to generate only mpox infection-related literature were as follows: mpox virus, epidemiology of mpox infection, clinical characteristics of mpox infection, diagnosis and treatment of mpox infection, and pathogenesis of mpox virus. exclusion criteria were also set. studies that did not meet the current inclusion criteria or were irrelevant to the topic, abstracts, conference proceedings, editorials, and commentaries with insufficient data were excluded. 3. history the mpox virus, which is a member of the orthopoxvirus family, causes a zoonotic disease similar to smallpox in humans. the variola virus, the vaccinia virus, and the cowpox virus are all members of this genus. they are 200 to 250 nm brick-shaped enveloped viruses with characteristic surface tubules and a dumb-bell-shaped core component. in the period between 1958 to 1968, a large number of primates were imported from asia, and a few from africa, into europe and the united states to be used in developing and testing the polio vaccine. while they were in transit, they were often accompanied by other wild animals, which created a lot of opportunities for infection to spread. at the statens serum institut, copenhagen, denmark, preben von magnus first noticed mpox in 1958, when he observed two non-fatal outbreaks of mpox affecting laboratory cynomolgus monkeys after 51 and 62 days of the shipments from singapore via air transport. subsequently, while performing routine investigations, it was found that the mpox virus was present in the kidneys of monkeys that showed no symptoms and had otherwise been healthy. in asia, the virus has never been found, and it is generally believed that the occurrence of the virus in asian monkeys is a result of their catching the disease in captivity or in transit. it is thought that some previous cases of a pox outbreak, thought to be smallpox, among monkeys, may have actually been mpox. in the 1960s, several lab monkeys were often found to have mpox in european and american laboratories, including at the walter reed army institute of research in 1962, where several monkeys had antibodies and no symptoms following exposure to mpox. after 1968, there were no more cases of monkeys dying in laboratories, as the conditions for monkeys in labs improved and the number of monkeys coming from asia and africa decreased. until 1965, when mpox was first discovered at rotterdam zoo, it was thought that mpox only occurred in primates. however, the disease was first detected among the giant anteaters from central and south america, before affecting several orangutans, chimpanzees, gorillas, guenons, squirrel monkeys, macaques, marmosets and gibbons, and 11 of the 23 animals died as a result of it. orangutans were most severely affected by the disease. at the time, the mpox virus was also isolated from the kidneys of healthy monkeys, but it was later revealed that the virus was most likely due to contamination from samples from the zoo that were undergoing examination at the same laboratory as the mpox virus. during the smallpox eradication efforts in 1970, the first documented cases of mpox in humans were found in six unvaccinated children, with the first one being in a 9-month-old boy in the democratic republic of the congo. three of the others were from liberia and sierra leone. one notable fact about mpox is that it is less contagious than smallpox. in the period from 1981 to 1986, more than 300 cases of mpox were reported in the drc, the majority of them linked to animal contact. approximately 88% of the cases resulting from human-to-human transmission were reported in the democratic republic of the congo in 1996. in equatorial central and western africa, there are regular outbreaks of viral infections with death rates around 10% and human-to-human transmission rates around the same. there was no outbreak of mpox in the united states until 2003, when a concurrent mpox outbreak took place in the rain forests of western and central africa. a number of cases have been traced back to ghanaian rodents that were imported. prairie dogs in the regions of africa contracted the disease and passed it on to their owners. although deaths in prairie dogs were observed, no human fatality was recorded. it has been reported that the disease had spread to at least ten african countries between 1970 and 2019, mainly in central and west africa. a case of mpox was diagnosed in the united kingdom, in 2018, among two passengers who had travelled from nigeria. in the uk, the first case of human-to-human transmission outside of africa was confirmed in that year. it is possible that the person contracted the disease from contaminated bed linen, while working as a healthcare worker. after that, more cases were reported in the uk between 2019 and 2021. the disease has also been reported in travellers from israel and singapore. 4. origin and spread of mpox virus since the first human case of mpox was reported in the democratic republic of the congo, over 65 years ago, there have been various outbreaks and sporadic cases in many areas of central and west africa. it has been reported that most cases have occurred in remote rainforest areas of the congo basin, particularly in the democratic republic of the congo. human cases have also increasingly been reported in parts of central and western africa. a total of 11 african countries have reported human mpox cases since 1970, including benin, cameroon, the central african republic, the democratic republic of the congo, gabon, cote d’ivoire, liberia, nigeria, the republic of the congo, sierra leone and south sudan. during 1996–97, the democratic republic of the congo experienced an outbreak that was characterized by a lower-case fatality ratio and a higher attack rate than normal. it was found, in this case, that chickenpox and mpox were occurring concurrently. this could explain any observed changes in transmission dynamics in this case. the outbreak in nigeria that began in 2017 was a large one, with over 500 suspected cases and 200 confirmed cases, and a case fatality ratio of approximately 3%. until this day, cases continue to come to light. since mpox does not only affect countries in africa, but the rest of the world as well, the disease is of global importance when it comes to public health. a mpox outbreak occurred in the united states in 2003, the first mpox outbreak outside of africa, and the cause was found to be contact with infected pet prairie dogs. they were housed together with gambian pouched rats and dormice that were imported into the country from ghana. during this outbreak, over 70 cases of mpox were reported in the united states. mpox has also been reported to have been transferred from travellers from nigeria to israel as well as to travellers from the uk, united states of america and singapore. multiple mpox cases have been reported in several countries outside the endemic area since may 2022. currently, there are studies being conducted to better understand the epidemiology, sources of infection, and patterns of transmission of the disease. a zoonotic transmission can take place through direct contact with blood, bodily fluids or by contact with the lesions on the skin or mucosa of animals that are infected. there has been evidence of mpox virus infection in many species of animals found in africa, including tree squirrels, rope squirrels, gambian pouched rats, and dormice, as well as various monkey species. it remains unclear which animal is the natural reservoir for mpox, but rodents would probably be the most likely. it is possible to contract the disease from eating infected meat that has not been properly cooked. in some cases, people living in or near forested areas may be indirectly exposed to infected animals due to their proximity. transmission of the virus from person-to-person can be caused by close contact with respiratory secretions, lesions on the skin of an infected person, or recently contaminated objects. health workers, household members and other close contacts of persons who are infected with the disease are at greater risk, as droplet respiratory particles are required to transmit the infection via prolonged face-to-face contact. it has been documented in the past few years that the longest ever documented chain of transmission has increased from six to nine successive person-to-person infections within one community. there is also the possibility that mpox can be transmitted via the placenta from a mother to a foetus. the close physical contact that can occur in the context of mpox is well known as a risk factor for transmission; as of now, it is clear that mpox can be transmitted specifically through sexual means. therefore, it is important to conduct further research to gain a better understanding of the disease. 5. transmission and circulation of mpox in human populations mpox first became known to humans in 1970 in basankusu, équateur province, in the democratic republic of the congo. the who recorded 338 confirmed cases between 1981 and 1986 in the democratic republic of the congo/zaire. in 1996–1997, a second outbreak of human illness was reported in the democratic republic of the congo and zaire province. between 1991 and 1999, there were 511 cases reported in the democratic republic of the congo/zaire. the congo basin clade of diseases still continues to be endemic in the drc and has a high case fatality ratio. by may 2022, the case fatality rate for outbreaks from the past had been around 3% to 6%, while the cfr for the outbreak that occurred in 2022 remained less than 1%. there was no record of human-to-human transmission of mpox until the 2022 outbreak of mpox in europe. in 2003, mpox was reported in the midwestern united states among owners of pet prairie dogs belonging to clade ii, the first outbreak outside africa. there were reportedly 71 people infected with the disease, none of whom died as a result. mpox has traditionally been associated with tropical rainforests and their ecology. it was only in 2005 that the pattern was broken, when 49 cases of the disease were reported in south sudan with no deaths. genetic analysis indicates that the virus did not originate in sudan, but was imported from the democratic republic of the congo. a significant increase in mpox cases has occurred in central and western africa, especially in the democratic republic of the congo, where 2000 cases per year have been reported between 2011 and 2014. there are many instances in which the data collected is incomplete or unconfirmed, causing unrealistic estimations of the number of mpox cases over a period of time. in spite of this, it has been suggested that the number of reported cases of mpox has increased and the geographical occurrences became more widespread in 2018. 5.1. united states outbreak an infant became ill after being bitten by a prairie dog bought at a swap meet near milwaukee, wisconsin, in may 2003. a total of 71 cases of mpox had been reported by the end of 2003. all of the cases have been linked to the importation of gambian pouched rats from accra, ghana, in april 2003, by an exotic animal distributor in texas. there were no reported deaths from this outbreak. a mpox patient generally experiences prodromal symptoms, such as fever, headaches, muscle aches, chills, drenching sweats, and drenching fever, when they have mpox. infected individuals were found to have non-productive coughs in about a third of the cases. 5.2. nigeria outbreak a mpox outbreak was reported in the south-eastern and southern parts of nigeria. the virus spread to the following states: akwaibom, abia, bayelsa, benue, cross river, delta, edo, ekiti, enugu, imo, lagos, nasarawa, oyo, plateau, rivers and federal capital territory. according to the information provided by the nigeria center for disease control, a total of ten cases of mpox in humans were reported during the period of 1971 to 1978. after almost 39 years, the outbreak started again in september 2017, and it has continued across multiple states as of may 2019. in 2017, the first case of mpox in humans was reported from the state bayelsa. the outbreak was characterized by infection, predominantly among young, male adults, without significant transmission to others, which is different from previous reports of the west african clade that includes all descendants of one common ancestor). several cases of genital ulcers, syphilis and hiv co-infection, as reported by the niger delta university teaching hospital, were found in young adults. there have been reports from the us center for disease control and prevention that american travellers who have returned from lagos and ibadan have contracted mpox. 5.3. united kingdom cases there was a case of mpox reported in the uk for the first time in september 2018. it is believed that the person, a nigerian citizen, contracted mpox in nigeria before travelling to the uk. in accordance with public health england, the individual had been staying at a naval base in cornwall when he was moved to the royal free hospital’s unit for infectious diseases. the people who had been in contact with the patient since he contracted the disease were contacted. there was a second case in the town of blackpool, england, along with yet another case that was associated with a medical staff member treating the blackpool case. a fourth mpox case was reported in england on 3 december 2019, when a person in southwest england was diagnosed with the disease. this individual had travelled from nigeria to the uk. a large outbreak of mpox has been reported in the uk in 2022 as part of the larger epidemic of mpox caused by the west african clade of the mpox virus. a total of 3504 cases of mpox have been confirmed as of 3 october 2022, and 150 cases are highly probable. 5.4. singapore case it was reported on 8 may 2019 that a 38-year-old man from nigeria, who had travelled to singapore from nigeria, was hospitalized in an isolation ward at the national centre for infectious diseases in singapore after it was confirmed that he was the first mpox case in singapore. this resulted in the quarantining of 22 individuals. the case may have been connected to an outbreak that was occurring concurrently in nigeria. 5.5. 2021 cases as of the 24th of may, public health wales had identified three cases of mpox from a single household in the uk. health secretary matt hancock announced the cases in an address to the house of commons. it was noted that the person with the infected organism had travelled from nigeria. it was reported that a second case occurred on 2nd june, and a third case was reported on 24th june. there was a case of mpox in the us on the 14th of july after an american returned from nigeria following a trip to the country. the virus was later identified as being a member of the west african clade of mpox virus. 5.6. current outbreak mpox was confirmed as a continuing outbreak in may of 2022, beginning with a cluster of cases reported from the uk. the first confirmed case of the disease was identified on 6 may 2022 and occurred in a traveller from nigeria; however, there is some evidence that cases had already been spreading in europe during the preceding months. a steadily growing number of cases have been reported from an increasing number of countries and regions since 18 may 2018, most notably from north and south america, asia, africa, and australia. as of 9 june, 1290 new cases have been confirmed. 6. clinical features mpox has an incubation period that is usually between six and thirteen days but could be anywhere from five to twenty. the duration of the infection can be split into two periods. the initial phase of the infection is characterized by fever, severe headache, lymphadenopathy, back pain, myalgia and intense asthenia. lymphadenopathy is a distinctive feature of mpox compared to other diseases that may initially appear similar. an eruption of the skin usually begins within one to three days after the appearance of fever. it is more common for the rash to appear on the face and extremities rather than on the trunk when the condition is present. in 95% of cases, the face and palms of the hands are affected, whereas it only affects 75% of cases on the soles of the feet. aside from the oral mucous membranes, other types of mucous membrane, genitalia, conjunctivas, and corneas, are also affected. generally, the lesions begin as macules and then progress into papules, vesicles, pustules, and crusts, which eventually dry up and fall off. in general, there are between a few and several thousand lesions present. lesions can coalesce and slough off in large sections when they are severe enough. an infection of mpox usually lasts from two to four weeks, with symptoms lasting from the start of the disease to the end. infection severity is more common in children and is dependent on the level of virus exposure, the patient’s health status, and the type of complications. the severity of the infection may be affected by underlying immunodeficiencies. owing to the cessation of smallpox vaccination campaigns globally after the eradication of the disease, persons younger than 40 to 50 years of age may be more susceptible to mpox than in the past because of their immune systems being ineffective against smallpox. in addition, mpox can also cause secondary infections such as bronchopneumonia, sepsis, encephalitis and corneal infection with ensuing loss of vision. the extent to which infections may occur asymptomatically is not known. during the outbreak of mpox in 2022, many of the patients presented with genital and peri-anal lesions, fever, swollen lymph nodes, and pain when swallowing, with some of the patients manifesting only a few sores as a result of the disease. in the general population, the case fatality ratio for mpox historically ranges from 0 to 11%, while young children’s case fatality rates tend to be higher. currently, it is estimated that the case fatality ratio is between 3 and 6%. 7. diagnosis among other possible diagnoses that must be considered when making a clinical differential diagnosis are chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, syphilis and medication-associated allergies. lymphadenopathy is a clinical feature that assists in distinguishing mpox from chickenpox or smallpox at the prodromal stage of the illness. if mpox is suspected, a sample should be collected and safely transported to a laboratory with the necessary capabilities. in order to confirm the presence of mpox, skin lesion material including swabs of the lesion surface and/or exudate, roofs from multiple lesions, or crusts from skin lesions, are the recommended specimen type for laboratory testing via conventional polymerase chain reaction, real-time pcr, or pcr in combination with dna sequencing. therefore, specimens should be packaged according to national and international requirements and should be shipped accordingly. the traditional techniques of viral isolation and electron microscopy, as well as immunohistochemistry, remain valid, but require advanced technical skills and a sophisticated laboratory. specimens can be examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction to detect orthopoxvirus and mpox virus. these methods are sensitive and can detect viral dna efficiently. presently, real-time pcr works best in a major laboratory, which limits its application as a real-time diagnostic tool in rural areas with limited resources. the use of real-time pcr for diagnostic purposes outside of major laboratories may become more feasible due to advances in technology. antibody-based diagnostics can be used to determine the cause of cases identified retrospectively. orthopoxvirus immunological assays are cross-reactive with a variety of orthopoxviruses, making them useful in areas where the virus responsible for the illness is already known. for retrospective patients who have been exposed to orthopoxviruses, including through vaccination, anti-orthopoxvirus antibody g, alone, is not enough to diagnose the disease. however, serological assays assessing anti-orthopoxvirus immunoglobulin m are more useful for diagnosing recent retrospective infections, including in individuals who have previously been vaccinated. the most appropriate samples for diagnosing mpox are from the skin lesions—the roof and the fluid from vesicles and pustules, and the crusts of the skin lesions. biopsies can also be performed under certain circumstances. it is essential to store lesion samples in a sterile dry tube and to keep them cold. a pcr test is usually inconclusive since viremia tends to last only for a short time relative to the time the specimens are collected after symptoms begin, and specimens cannot be collected routinely from patients. there has been little progress in developing a point-of-care test that can be deployed in the field. based on lesion samples from acute infections caused by orthopoxvirus, a recent pilot study of the tetracore orthopox bio threat alert showed promising results. this assay has shown that vaccinia and mpox viruses can be reliably detected in serum preparations containing 107 plaque-forming units/ml; five out of six clinical specimens were correctly identified. despite not being specific to the mpox virus, this assay could be used for orthopoxvirus confirmation by proxy in mpox-endemic areas, and it is critical to test this in endemic settings. currently, the who recommend nucleic acid amplification testing to detect the mpox viral genome, hemagglutinin, the acidophilic-type inclusion body and the crmb genes. however, there is still a need for developing assays that can be tested in very basic environments with limited training of personnel, since patients with mpox virus often seek diagnosis and care at rural clinics and hospitals without electricity. specific information is critical to allow for an accurate interpretation of test results such as the date of the onset of fever, the date of the onset of rash, the date of specimen collection, the current state of the individual’s condition, and the patient’s age. 8. therapeutics and vaccines clinical care for mpox should be fully optimized to alleviate symptoms, manage complications, and prevent long-term sequelae. patients should be offered fluids and food to maintain adequate nutritional status and treated for any secondary bacterial infections, which can lead to a high mortality rate, especially in critically ill patients. during outbreaks, several treatments are used to tackle these infections. for example, an antiviral agent known as tecovirimat, or tpoxx, st-246, is fda approved for smallpox infections. it is currently used for other orthopoxvirus infections, including mpox-infected patients in animal and human studies, but it is still not fda approved for clinical use. the use of tecovirimat should be monitored in a clinical research context with prospective data collection. the information about a few drugs that can be utilized for the treatment of mpox infection are presented here. 8.1. tecovirimat tecovirimat is an antiviral drug that has been approved by the united states food and drug administration to treat smallpox infection in adults, as well as children. it is recommended to take antiviral medication for those who have severe illness, or those who are at risk of developing it, or who have lesions in their eyes, mouth, or anogenital region that may signal the presence of the disease. although there are no clinical data available at this time regarding tecovirimat, it appears to be well-tolerated and has the potential of decreasing the duration of an infection and the shedding of viral particles. there is currently a clinical trial being carried out to assess how well tecovirimat treats mpox. the center for disease control and prevention recommends taking the medication tecovirimat for pregnant or nursing women who have been infected with mpox virus. in spite of this, the only source of information regarding the effects of tecovirimat on the foetus comes from animal studies. in those studies, tecovirimat was administered orally to animals at doses approximately 23 times higher than those that are generally recommended for humans in the form of a prescription drug. however, no specific adverse effects on the foetus were observed during the study. there are many children with mpox that need to be treated with tecovirimat if they have severe disease, such as airway obstruction, confluent lesions, and encephalitis. in addition, tecovirimat treatment may be needed for those that have consequences, as well as lesions involving anatomical sites that would cause scarring or strictures. the use of antiviral medication should be considered an option for children under the age of eight, children suffering from conditions such as eczema and other skin disorders, as well as children with immunocompromised systems. the safety experiments on about 360 volunteers were conducted as part of the approval process to determine whether tecovirimat has any adverse effects, and the results showed that its adverse effect profile was comparable to that of a placebo. as far as side effects are concerned, headaches, nausea, and abdominal pain are the most commonly reported side effects. the median time to subjective benefit after commencing tecovirimat was three days after the start of the medication in a study that included 255 patients. it is also effective against mpox infection in nonhuman primates. 8.2. cidofovir in 2012, the fda approved a new antiviral drug called cidofovir. the drug is an injection-based antiviral drug that is used to treat cytomegalovirus infection retinitis among aids patients. however, it is not known whether cidofovir is effective in treating mpox infection in humans. the effectiveness of cidofovir treatment, however, has been shown in some in vitro and animal studies caused by orthopoxviruses. when a patient suffers from a severe mpox infection, cidofovir may be considered as a possible treatment option, although it is unknown whether the treatment offers any benefits. it has been reported that the use of this drug can have significant adverse effects, such as nephrotoxicity. 8.3. brincidofovir brincidofovir is a formulation of the drug cidofovir that is taken orally. brincidofovir may have a better safety profile than that of cidofovir. it should be noted that when treating cytomegalovirus infections with brincidofovir, serious renal damage or other side effects have not been reported in comparison to the use of cidofovir. the u.s. food and drug administration approved the use of brincidofovir for the treatment of smallpox, starting in june 2021. there have only been a few studies that have documented its effectiveness in treating mpox infection. based on animal studies, brincidofovir has been shown to be effective against orthopoxvirus infections. however, it was documented that three mpox patients who were given brincidofovir, all experienced an increase in liver enzyme levels, resulting in the discontinuation of the treatment. although there is a need to develop strategies to use these drugs in endemic areas to treat disease; nevertheless, natural products and their extracts could be a promising source for potential antiviral drugs. the effectiveness of smallpox vaccination in preventing mpox has been demonstrated to be about 85% in several observational studies. therefore, previous smallpox vaccination could have a mild effect on mpox infection. in most cases, a scar can be found on the upper arm of a person who has previously been vaccinated against smallpox. it should be noted that, at this point in time, the original smallpox vaccines are no longer available to the general public. there is a possibility that some laboratory technicians or health care workers may have received a recent smallpox vaccine to protect them against orthopoxviruses acquired on the job as a result of occupational exposure. the fda approved a second vaccine based on a modified attenuated version of the vaccinia virus for use in 2019 as a preventative management tool for mpox. this vaccine consists of two doses and remains limited in availability. in order to develop smallpox and mpox vaccines, formulations based on the vaccinia virus are utilized due to the cross-protection afforded by the antiviral response to orthopoxviruses. 8.4. potential therapeutic targets a previous study has shown that the mpox genome shares 96.3% of its dna with the smallpox genome, which encodes several essential enzymes and proteins that are important to its survival. consequently, the inhibition of such a broad range of enzymes and proteins through a drug molecule could represent one of the potential therapeutic strategies. a number of important potential therapeutic targets for treating mpox infection are discussed here. 8.5. thymidylate kinase as previously reported, thymidylate kinase has been found to form complexes with thymidine diphosphate. this is a novel target of interest due to the fact that no known drugs have yet been developed to target this enzyme. it has been found that a48r plays an important role in the conversion of thymidine monophosphate into its diphosphate, as well as in the conversion of the analogues of 5′ halogenated deoxyuridine monophosphate into its diphosphate. since the active site of human thymidylate kinase exhibits substantial structural differences from the structurally related human analogue, it might become an attractive target for the development of thymidine analogues without being too concerned with restricting the function of the human analogue. 8.6. dna ligase dna ligase is an important enzyme, which is essential for virus replication. a mutation at its n-terminus has resulted in instances of resistance to antiviral drugs in this protein. this location of resistance mutations indicates that the active site of the drug is situated at this location, which makes it a valuable target for drug discovery. 8.7. d13l a major capsid protein, d13l, is part of a protein trimer complex and contributes to the rigidity of the membrane of the virus particles; thus is particularly important in the morphogenesis of the viral particle. there is a strong correlation between rifampin and the d13l protein in the vaccinia virus, which has previously been demonstrated to have an affinity for this protein. as a result of its ability to bind to the d13l trimer complex, rifampin has been demonstrated to inhibit poxvirus assembly, an effect independent of its antibacterial activity. 8.8. f13l a drug called tecovirimat is the only drug approved to treat poxviruses that target the f13l gene. as a major envelope protein, as well as a palmitoylated membrane protein, it plays a crucial role in the formation of extracellular envelope viruses as well as the entry of viruses into cells. 8.9. i7l there is a proteinase known as i7l core proteinase that is a cysteine proteinase which cleaves the major structural and membrane proteins of both viruses and bacteria. as a result of their essential role in the replication of viruses by cleaving precursor polyproteins, proteases are ideal therapeutic targets, and protease inhibitors for other viruses, such as hiv, have also been confirmed to be effective against other viral proteases. due to this, mpox virus proteases are also attractive targets for inhibiting the replication of the virus. previously, ttp-6171 was identified as an inhibitor of the i7l enzyme in previous studies. there is also the possibility that drug-resistant i7l can be generated with mutations on the i7l gene. 9. prevention in order to prevent mpox, the main prevention strategy is to raise awareness about the risk factors, and to educate people about the steps they can take to reduce their exposure to the virus. scientists are currently studying whether and to what extent vaccination would be effective in the prevention and treatment of mpox in many countries around the globe. as a result, certain countries have policies in place, or are developing policies, to provide vaccines to persons who may be at risk, such as laboratory personnel, rapid response teams, and healthcare workers. as a means of preventing mpox, it is necessary to reduce the risk of the disease spreading from human to human. in order to contain an outbreak, it is critical to conduct surveillance, and to identify new cases as soon as possible. close contact with a person who is infected with the human mpox virus is the most significant risk factor for the infection. the risk of infection is higher among health workers and household members. thus, it is recommended that health care workers who are caring for patients or handling specimens of mpox should follow standard infection control precautions. whenever possible, persons who have previously been vaccinated against smallpox should be selected to be caregivers for the patient. the handling of mpox virus-infected people and animals should be carried out by trained personnel who work in laboratories that are appropriately equipped. in accordance with the who guidelines for the transportation of infectious substances, patient specimens must be carefully prepared for transport with three layers of packaging. there are clusters of mpox cases identified in may 2022 in several non-endemic countries with no direct travel ties to endemic areas. this is highly unusual. in order to determine the likely source of infection and limit further spread of the disease, more investigations are in progress. in addition to investigating the source of this outbreak, it is also important to examine all possible means of transmission in order to protect public health. in addition, it is important to reduce the risk of transmission of zoonotic diseases. since the advent of animal-to-human transmissions, most human infections have been transmitted through animals. in order to maintain safety, unprotected touching of wild animals, especially when they are sick or dead, as well as handling or consuming their meat, blood and other parts, must be avoided. furthermore, all foods containing animal meat or animal parts must be thoroughly cooked before consumption. moreover, mpox can also be reduced by limiting the trade in animals, which is another essential step toward the prevention of this disease. in a few countries in the world, legislation has been enacted which imposes restrictions on rodent imports as well as on imports of non-human primates. if captive animals are suspected of being infected with mpox, they should be quarantined from other animals immediately and kept in isolation. it is important to quarantine any animals that might have come into contact with an infected animal, handle them in accordance with the standard precautions, and monitor them for mpox symptoms for at least 30 days after such contact. 10. research challenges with mpox in order to better understand the dynamics of mpox transmission and control, operational research is currently facing challenges, such as insufficient resources for detailed case investigations and contact follow-up in affected communities. a lack of adequate diagnostic facilities in the laboratory is a serious problem. owing to the lack of laboratory diagnosis capacity and access, as well as the difficulty of diagnosing mpox, it is difficult to discover any underlying aetiology. a seroprevalence study would help to understand the epidemiology and subclinical infection among contacts in communities. the currently available serological assays are generic orthopox tests, meaning they do not specifically test for the mpox virus. this is due to the fact that there is cross-reactivity between mpox and smallpox viruses and, therefore, we cannot distinguish between a mpox virus infection and prior smallpox vaccinations or other orthopoxvirus infections. in addition, these assays are not currently available in the marketplace. it has been found that, according to data collected from nigeria, approximately 20% of 70 mpox-negative patients with a rash illness with similar antigens also had orthopox antibodies. in order to identify other orthopoxviruses being transmitted in human and animal populations, further research, including using molecular and genomic approaches, is needed. 11. conclusions in endemic and non-endemic countries alike, this outbreak of mpox has challenged economic, medical, and public health infrastructures all around the world. the impact of the virus on our lives will only be known in the future. moreover, zoonotic viruses and pathogens are likely to continue causing outbreaks of disease in the future. as a result, in addition to curbing this outbreak, efforts must focus on ensuring that comprehensive measures are devised to prevent future outbreaks of zoonotic origin.
