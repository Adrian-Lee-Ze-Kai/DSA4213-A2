petent vaccinia virus in lyophilized form. after receiving fda approval in 2007, this vaccine was introduced as an alternative to dryvax® and approved for 18–64-year-old individuals, exhibiting similar safety profiles and complications, including progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, and encephalitis. acam2000®, administered for postexposure prophylaxis with a bifurcated needle, provides peak protection 28 days after vaccination, with reimmunization advised every three years for high-risk exposures and every 10 years for less virulent strains like cowpox. immunosuppressed populations, such as those suffering from leukemia, lymphoma, hiv infection, patients with metastatic malignancies, transplant recipients, and undergoing cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy individuals or taking corticosteroids with a dose of ≥ 2 mg/kg for ≥ 2 weeks and tnf inhibitors, are in a group for whom this vaccine is not recommended. having cardiac risk factors such as diabetes, smoking, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia is a contraindication for acam2000® due to the high risk of myopericarditis, which can present with symptoms such as dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations, and ecg abnormalities in these individuals. unlike acam2000®, which is derived from a clonal isolate of dryvax, lc16m8 is a third-generation vaccine derived from the first-generation lister strain incorporating a deletion in the b5r immunogenic membrane protein, produced in cell culture using rabbit kidney cells. this minimally replicating vaccinia virus vaccine has demonstrated effectiveness in postexposure prophylaxis when administered within 4–14 days after close contact, regardless of prior smallpox vaccination, and it is the only vaccine authorized for use in children among the three mpox vaccines. another third-generation vaccine, modified vaccinia ankara, branded as imvanex® and jynneos®, has demonstrated adequate cellular and humoral immunity in animal models. the vaccine is administered intradermally in two doses, specifically on day 0 and day 28, by fda guidelines. this vaccine is exceptionally safe for individuals with compromised immune systems, as it does not use live viruses, significantly reducing the risk of infection. in recent years, mrna-based vaccines have been developed and introduced as novel vaccines, with high efficacy in triggering both humoral and cellular immune responses and with faster production against tumor cells and viruses. self-amplifying rna and nonreplicating mrna vaccines are two types of rna vaccines. sarna vaccines contain the code for both the target antigen and a replicase complex, while nonreplicating vaccines contain the code for only the target antigen. in addition to viral infections, the applications of sarna vaccines have expanded to include bacterial infections, parasitic infections, and cancers. the mpox is a new target for this novel vaccine technology. for instance, in sang and colleagues' study, the immunogenicity of an mpox virus quadrivalent mrna vaccine, which was prepared using a29l, a35r, m1r, and b6r as antigen targets, was evaluated in mice. as a result, they observed a strong cellular and memory cell immune response against mpox without any significant rise in inflammatory cytokines or histopathological changes in the mice. a multiepitope-based vaccine is another novel approach against mpox, which shantier and coworkers have developed. this safe, innovative vaccine elicits an immune response against the mpox by utilizing cell surface binding proteins, without causing side effects. 3.12. ai and mpox deep learning is a specific branch of machine learning that falls within the broader field of ai. it is distinguished by its capacity to utilize neural networks with numerous layers to identify and represent intricate patterns in large datasets. dl has gained significant recognition for its revolutionary applications in the field of medical science. significantly, it aids in the identification of illnesses by allowing the examination of various imaging techniques, spanning from basic skin pictures to advanced diagnostic instruments such as ct scans and mris, largely utilizing convolutional neural networks. furthermore, dl plays a crucial role in the detection of pathogens via genomic sequencing. utilizing recurrent neural networks improve diagnostic accuracy. recent research on highly transmissible infectious diseases like mpox has focused on dl to examine skin lesions and detect them early. in a 2022 study, mobilenetv2 showed the highest accuracy at 91.11% in binary classification with a sample size of 169. vgg16 and vgg19 are cnn models trained on imagenet, while resnet50 and resnet101 are residual networks. the vision transformer, introduced by dosovitskiy et al., is a pretrained model for image classification that treats images as sequences of patches processed by a transformer encoder, with a multilayer perceptron normalizer, multihead attention mechanism, and embedded patches forming its architecture. this new model has uses outside the ones described. in a study by chaturvedi et al. on the epidemiological and behavioral elements influencing mpox transmission, it was proposed that, much as with smallpox vaccination, variations in transmission probability—whether sexual or nonsexual—had a significant impact on mpox in their model. furthermore, in the absence of pre-exposure vaccination, contact tracing's precision and timeliness proved to be quite important in reducing mpox flow within the model. drug discovery and vaccine production through molecular modeling and virtual screening, personalized treatment aimed at achieving the most therapeutic effect with fewer adverse events, and optimal public health policies are just a few examples of how ai can play a role in medical science. 3.13. policy implications and future research studies policymakers should focus on vaccination campaigns targeting high-risk groups, including healthcare workers, msm, and immunocompromised individuals, particularly in regions with clade 1b cases. establishing genomic surveillance systems is also essential for monitoring mpox strain evolution and enabling proactive health responses. despite progress, gaps remain in mpox research. the long-term efficacy of existing smallpox vaccines against mpox is still unclear, and ai diagnostic tools need real-world validation. the transmission dynamics among msm highlight the importance of understanding demographic factors for effective public health interventions. high rates of hiv coinfection in mpox patients indicate the need for integrated care approaches. future research should prioritize the development of next-generation mpox-specific vaccines, mainly using mrna technologies, and expand the use of ai for outbreak surveillance. addressing transmission's social and behavioral aspects is crucial for reducing stigma and promoting preventive measures. evaluating current public health policies will provide valuable insights for refining strategies for future outbreaks. by addressing these issues and utilizing innovative tools, global health systems can enhance their preparedness and response to mpox and other emerging infectious diseases. 4. conclusion the covid-19 pandemic and the 2022 mpox outbreak highlighted the urgent need to handle viruses and their potential to cause widespread epidemics and devastation. developing specific treatments and effective vaccinations for viruses such as sars-cov-2, mpox, zika virus, and ebola can be challenging due to mutations that alter transmission patterns and clinical properties. this review contributes to this field by providing comprehensive data on various aspects of mpox infection. modern medications can be developed with a thorough knowledge of viral structures and the protein and nonprotein components engaged in their pathogenesis and life cycle this knowledge enables the design of drugs against them. many of these structures can be addressed by medications used for different purposes; network pharmacology helps one to find these targets. monoclonal antibodies and new chemical therapies can target these structures. raising public awareness about immunization, preventive measures, and sexual health behaviors is essential, especially for gay individuals and those with multiple sexual partners. combining traditional knowledge of diseases with modern ai technology can help us tackle the challenges of mpox more effectively. policymakers, doctors, and researchers must work together to create strategies that improve preparedness, lower the risks of outbreaks, and enhance patient care. the global health community can strengthen its response to mpox and other emerging infectious diseases by finding and addressing gaps in our current approach.
insights into the transmission, host range, genomics, vaccination, and current epidemiology of the monkeypox virus abstract this review delves into the historical context, current epidemiological landscape, genomics, and pathobiology of monkeypox virus. furthermore, it elucidates the present vaccination status and strategies to curb the spread of monkeypox. monkeypox, caused by the orthopoxvirus known as mpxv, is a zoonotic ailment. mpxv can be transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets during prolonged face-to-face interactions. while many cases of monkeypox are self-limiting, vulnerable groups such as young children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals may experience severe manifestations. diagnosis predominantly relies on clinical presentations, complemented by laboratory techniques like rt-pcr. although treatment is often not required, severe cases necessitate antiviral medications like tecovirimat, cidofovir, and brincidofovir. vaccination, particularly using the smallpox vaccine, has proven instrumental in outbreak control, exhibiting an efficacy of at least 85% against mpox as evidenced by data from africa. mitigating transmission requires measures like wearing surgical masks, adequately covering skin lesions, and avoiding handling wild animals. 1. introduction monkeypox, commonly referred to as “mpox,” is a reemerging zoonotic condition characterized by symptoms reminiscent of smallpox in humans and certain animals, caused by the monkeypox virus. the world health organization has recently transitioned to using “mpox” over the traditional term “monkeypox”. mpxv, a double-stranded dna virus, falls within the orthopoxvirus genus of the poxviridae family, sharing this category with other human-pathogenic species such as vaccinia, variola, and cowpox. while the major variola virus, responsible for asian smallpox, boasts a fatality rate between 20% and 45%, its attenuated counterpart, variola minor or alastrim, sees rates between 1% and 2%. mpxv shares close genetic and clinical ties with the variola virus; however, mpox typically presents milder symptoms than smallpox. in unvaccinated populations, mpox can exhibit fatality rates up to 10%. research conducted with about 1800 cases of mpox in the democratic republic of the congo showed that individuals unvaccinated against smallpox had a 2.73- and 9.64-fold higher chance of contracting mpox in comparison to those vaccinated against smallpox. other studies conducted in the usa and spain similarly demonstrated a higher risk of contracting mpox among unvaccinated individuals compared to those who had received the smallpox vaccine. the virus manifests in two distinct subtypes: clade i and clade ii, previously associated with the geographic domains of the congo basin and west africa, respectively. while both clades can induce significant illness, they often resolve without intervention. the west african clade's mortality rate stands below 4%, whereas the congo basin variant can escalate to 10%. mpox poses specific risks to children and can lead to complications like congenital mpox or stillbirth during pregnancy. the disease's nomenclature stems from its 1958 discovery, following two outbreaks mimicking pox in research monkeys. the inaugural human mpox case was detected in the democratic republic of congo in 1970. since then, human cases of mpox have been verified in multiple countries, including cameroon, the central african republic, côte d'ivoire, democratic republic of congo, gabon, liberia, nigeria, republic of the congo, and sierra leone. the majority of cases have been reported in the democratic republic of congo. in 2003, the us experienced an outbreak of mpox. over the past several decades, there has been a tenfold increase in the number of monkeypox cases. notably, the median age of affected individuals has shifted from young children, approximately 4 years old in the 1970s, to young adults with a median age of 21 years during the period from 2010 to 2019. this epidemiological shift might be attributed to the discontinuation of smallpox vaccinations, which historically provided some degree of cross-protection against mpox. despite being identified 70 years ago, mpox has often been overlooked in medical literature, primarily due to its perception as a rare and self-resolving condition. on may 6, 2022, an outbreak of mpox was identified, originating from a british individual who contracted the illness during a visit to nigeria, a country where the disease is endemic. by october 31, 2022, the disease had spread to over 100 countries, resulting in 77,092 confirmed cases across nations like australia, the uk, the us, and various european countries. by early september 2023, the tally of laboratory-confirmed mpox cases had risen to 89,752. cases outside africa have largely been linked to international travel or the importation of animals. the cdc indicates that while the primary reservoir of the mpox virus remains unidentified, it is believed that african rodents and certain nonhuman primates, such as monkeys, might transmit the virus to humans. the escalating number of individuals affected by mpxv necessitates an in-depth examination. this review aims to shed light on the multifaceted dimensions of the recent mpox surge. it provides an updated account of the history and present state of the mpxv disease, delving into its modes of transmission, current epidemiological landscape, and pathobiology, with a particular focus on the virus's genomic makeup. moreover, this study presents an overview of the antiviral medications and vaccines available for the treatment and containment of mpxv infections. 2. history in 1958, the renowned danish virologist preben von magnus, recognized for his contributions to polio vaccines, influenza, and mpox research, identified mpox in cynomolgus monkeys within a danish laboratory setting. this discovery followed two outbreaks resembling smallpox in monkey colonies, originally from malaysia, which were later transported to singapore. by 1964, another mpox outbreak was noted at the rotterdam zoo, and soon after, instances of the disease were identified in laboratory monkeys within the us. after 1968, incidents of mpox in laboratory monkeys declined, attributed to enhanced living conditions for the animals and a reduced demand for monkeys from asia and africa, primarily used in polio vaccine production. the presence of the virus in asian monkeys, despite the virus not being native to asia, likely resulted from contamination or infections acquired during captivity or transit. historically, mpox was often misdiagnosed as smallpox, chickenpox, shingles, and herpes. however, as the severity and outbreak potential of mpox became evident, accurate diagnosis grew in importance. the inaugural documented human case of mpox appeared in 1970, afflicting an unvaccinated infant, just nine months old, in the équateur province of the democratic republic of the congo. intriguingly, this occurrence was post the eradication of smallpox in the region in 1968. since the initial identification of monkeypox, the majority of human cases have predominantly originated from the rural rainforest regions of the congo basin, especially in the democratic republic of congo. the disease has been documented across central and west africa. from 1970 onwards, mpox cases have emerged in 11 african countries, including benin, cameroon, democratic republic of congo, central african republic, gabon, côte d'ivoire, liberia, sierra leone, nigeria, republic of congo, and south sudan. during the decade from 1970 to 1979, approximately 50 cases were reported, with the democratic republic of congo accounting for over two-thirds of these instances. other countries, such as liberia, sierra leone, the ivory coast, and nigeria, also reported cases during this period. subsequently, since 1986, over 400 human cases have been recorded. it is noteworthy that in tropical central and west africa, sporadic viral outbreaks often occur, characterized by a 10% mortality rate and a 10% rate of secondary human-to-human transmission. the most significant mpox outbreak was observed between february 1996 and february 1997 in these regions. outside africa, the first significant outbreak in the us occurred in 2003. this outbreak was linked to human contact with infected pet prairie dogs, which were housed with gambian pouched rats and dormice imported from ghana. following an outbreak, over 70 instances of monkeypox were recorded in the us. subsequent cases of mpox were identified in travelers from nigeria to various countries: israel in september 2018, singapore in may 2019, the uk in december 2019, and the us in july and november 2021, as well as may 2021 and may 2022. remarkably, in may 2022, mpox cases emerged in several countries where the disease was previously nonendemic. the world health organization data indicate that from january 2022 to september 2023, mpox was reported across 114 countries/territories/areas, with a total of 89,752 laboratory-confirmed cases. tragically, 157 of these cases resulted in fatalities attributed to mpxv. 3. transmission, host, and zoonosis the specified method by which mpxv spreads to humans is unknown. however, when handling mpxv-infected animals, primary animal-to-human infection is thought to happen. animal-to-human transmission may occur through direct or indirect contact with the blood, body fluids, cutaneous lesions, or mucosal lesions of infected animals. the virus enters the body through skin breaks, some of which are not apparent, as well as the eyes, mouth, nose, and other regions of the respiratory tract. although mpxv's reservoir host is unknown, african rodents are thought to be involved in transmission. many african animals are infected with the mpxv, including tree squirrels, gambian pouched rats, rope squirrels, dormice, and monkey species. eating undercooked meat and other animal-derived products from diseased animals can be a possible risk factor. people living in or close to forested areas may be indirectly or minimally exposed to infected animals. the mpox outbreak in 2003 in the us began when prairie dogs in a pet shop were presumed to have been infected with the mpxv by a large gambian rat native to africa. the disease then spread through pet prairie dogs, infecting 70 people. also, secondary or human-to-human transmission is considered common. although human-to-human transmission is common, prior mpox outbreaks remained small and self-limiting because many people in the past have had some immunity from the late 20th-century smallpox mass vaccination programs. once the at-risk population developed immunity and local herd immunity was attained, the outbreak swiftly ended. the prevalence of mpox cases in may and june 2022 points to new transmission clusters from big gatherings, such as raves and festivals. human-to-human transmission can happen when people come into close contact with infected persons' skin sores, respiratory secretions, or recently contaminated objects. also, it can be transferred by touching a mpox-infected patient's clothing, bedding, or towels and through coughs and sneezes. large respiratory droplets are assumed to be the primary method of human-to-human transmission. and after transmission from infected animals or humans, mpox infection begins with dermal or respiratory epithelial infection. recently, prolonged mpox dna shedding from the upper respiratory tract following skin lesion resolution has been observed. therefore, there is a risk of mpox infection for those who are in close proximity to the patient during an aerosol-generating procedure and are not using a surgical face mask or respirator. long-term face-to-face contact is required since respiratory droplets can only travel a few feet. however, in the past few years, the number of person-to-person infections in the longest-known chain of transmission in a community increased from six to nine, which could be related to the loss of immunity in all groups due to the end of smallpox vaccination. also, transmission can happen by the placenta from the mother to the fetus or between and after birth through intimate contact. there have also been reports of transmission through tattoos, piercings, and sharp instruments. paul hunter, a professor of medicine at the university of east anglia's norwich school of medicine, said that “transmission of monkeypox seems to be almost exclusively being transmitted by close and intimate contact. so, people should avoid contact with people who could be infected, especially if they have a rash. also, the outbreak in the democratic republic of congo showed that the virus circulated quickly through households. the mpox is generally not a sexually transmitted disease, yet it can be transferred by direct touch during sex. the msm community is most affected by the current mpox outbreak, which does not indicate that we are dealing with a new mpox strain that only affects men or is sexually transmitted between men. world health organization also stated that everyone with intimate contact with an infectious person is at risk of contracting mpox. recently, in the enzootic areas, mpox was detected in teenagers too. and according to who, serious mpox cases were found in children and are correlated with the level of virus interaction. this outbreak was the first documented occurrence of mpox community transmission outside of africa and the first known case of transmission between men who have sex with men. before the outbreak in 2022, mpox was not considered an std. the virus's rapid spread between sexual partners in the initial stages of the outbreak led to speculation that sexual intercourse could be a different mode of transmission. according to epidemiologist david heymann, mpox was likely to spread sexually among msm in two waves in spain and belgium in 2022, which started the european outbreak. additionally, the cdc reevaluated recent outbreaks for potential transmissions, including kissing, hugging, oral, anal, and vaginal sex. these transmissions may be connected to genetic modifications facilitating the mpxv's human-to-human transmission. the primary risk factors for monkeypox virus transmission are summarized in table 1. 4. genomics the monkeypox virus belongs to the poxviridae family, the chordopoxvirinae subfamily, and the orthopoxvirus genus. the mpxv seems huge under electron microscopy. poxviruses are brick-shaped, and a lipoprotein envelope surrounds their linear double-stranded dna genome. poxviruses have all the necessary assembly, replication, transcription, and egress proteins in their genome despite their mrna translation's dependency on host ribosomes. mpxv, cowpox virus, variola virus, and vaccinia virus are among the many viruses in the poxviridae family, orthopoxvirus genus that have been observed to infect humans. although genetically and antigenically similar, orthopoxviruses vary in host range and pathogenicity features. according to comparative genomics studies, orthopoxvirus evolution is proceeding and can be influenced by a host species' selection pressure. it has been suggested that the evolution of these viruses was driven by progressive gene loss, particularly toward the ends of the genome. mpxv has a 197 kb linear dna genome with 190 nonoverlapping orfs greater than 180 nt. like all orthopoxviruses, mpxv's main coding region sequence at nucleotide positions 56,000–120,000 is highly conserved and surrounded by varying ends and inverted terminal repeats. most vacv homologs of genes discovered in the mpxv genome's terminal ends are engaged in immunomodulation, and the majority are expected or confirmed to impact pathogenicity and host range determination. in the itr region of mpxv, there are at least four orfs. mpxv strain evolution is influenced by genomic instability and genetic polymorphism. although host transition models predict genomic alterations, the relationship between gene loss and secondary transmission raises the possibility that it is evolving for effective replication in a novel ecological niche: humans. increased human-to-human transmission and the frequency of variation introduction could also be explained by some factors, such as vaccination status and human encroachment on reservoir habitats, linking omcp gene loss and transmissibility coincidentally. the virus is divided into two genetic clades: clade i and clade ii. observing the genomic sequences of mpxv, derived from congo basin and west african strains, revealed 99% identity with geographical areas and 95% identity with geographical clusters. the genetic sequence of the mpox virus from an infected portuguese man was identified in the current investigation. on may 4, 2022, a swab sample was taken from the patient's skin lesions. according to phylogenetic analyses, the sequence belonged to the west african clade. it was observed that the virus was the most closely connected to viruses linked to past nigerian exports to other nations in 2018 and 2019. the reference sequence is approximately 92 percent of the length of the draft sequence. however, according to who, no record exists that the mpxv has mutated. a single nucleotide variation was found between mpxv-usa-2003-039 and mpxv-usa-2003-044 viruses, originating from a similar source. a group of closely related, large, enclosed dna viruses called poxviruses only replicate inside the cytoplasm of vertebrate or invertebrate cells. the orthopoxvirus genus, part of the poxviridae family, contains numerous zoonotic viruses, including variola, vaccinia, cowpox, and mpox. the replication cycle of poxviruses provides information about how the mpox virus reproduces. poxviruses primarily rely on virus-encoded proteins to replicate in the cytoplasm. the linear, double-stranded genome and the virus-encoded proteins and enzymes that enable transcription of the initial set of genes are located in the infectious poxvirus's membrane-bound particle's core. initial mrna and protein synthesis is followed by dna replication. the late and intermediate classes of mrna can be produced using the duplicated dna as a template. according to the most recent findings, there are only 118 early, 53 intermediate, and 38 late genes in the poxvirus. the viral assembly process follows late gene expression, termed mature virions, the earliest infectious form. an extracellular virion is also released when the outer and plasma membranes merge. no matter the mechanism or whether the ev or mv drives infection, the fusion relies on 11-12 nonglycosylated transmembrane proteins with sizes varying between 4 and 43 kda linked together in a complex. evs have a loose outer membrane and are specialized for leaving the intact cell and spreading inside the host, while mvs have a relatively stable outer membrane. they are hypothesized to facilitate transmission among host animals. virostealth and virotransducer proteins are intracellular proteins. poxvirus proteins have virostealth and virotransducer activity. virotransducer proteins, especially those involved in oxidative bursts and apoptotic pathways, inhibit the cell's response to the specific infection. downregulating the immune recognition molecules, like the mhc 1 and cd4+ by the virostealth proteins, which have intracellular functions, lowers the host's immune system to detect viruses. respiratory and other rna viruses can escape the host's innate immune defense system. extracellular viromimic proteins fall into two categories, and both could regulate how the immune system reacts. some viromimic proteins act extracellularly and regulate immune responses. the host cytokines and chemokines are competitively bound by the baroreceptors, which are produced or present on the cell surface and inhibit the function of the host's cytokines and chemokines. therefore, virokines create viral mimics of host growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines that efficiently abolish host immune responses against viral survival and promote viral replication and dissemination. these modulatory proteins cooperate to circumvent and evade the host immune system. 5. pathobiology human mpox has a pathogenesis similar to smallpox, except that small skin lesions or oral mucous membranes are the most common routes for viral introduction from a wildlife source. in extremely rare cases of person-to-person transmission, viruses can also enter through the respiratory tract. the mpxv replicates in lymphoid tissue the same way as the smallpox virus but results in greater lymphadenopathy. the virus first expresses itself in mononuclear phagocytic cells and then spreads via the bloodstream before reappearing in the skin cells. the current incubation period of mpox is up to 21 days, with a mean incubation period of 8.5 days. in contrast, data from historical mpox outbreaks suggest the normal incubation period for a virus is 7 to 14 days, with a maximum of 21 days. the mpox is caused by an infection of the dermis following transmission from an infected animal or an infection of the respiratory epithelium following transmission from an infected person. the mpxv reproduces at the inoculation site after entering via any route, e.g., oropharynx, nasopharynx, or intradermal, and the viral entry is facilitated by the cell membrane fusion, micropinocytosis, and viral endocytosis processes. mpxv travels to the blood, local lymph nodes, tonsils, and other organs. primary viremia and systemic infection ensue from the virus's spread through the lymphatic system. symptom onset is linked to secondary viremia, which causes prodromal symptoms, including fever and lymphadenopathy, for one to two days before lesions emerge. at this time, infected patients may spread the virus. the lesions begin from the oropharynx and progress to the skin. around the time lesions appear, serum antibodies are frequently found. the second viremia causes epithelial infection, resulting in skin and mucosal sores. like other poxviruses, mpox has developed methods to avoid host immune responses. fever, weariness, headache, myalgia, and lymphadenopathy are the initial signs of mpox, distinguishing it from smallpox. the genital area might be an initial infection site for causing rash before progressing to subsequent lesions. recent data showed that, in 95% of the mpox cases, lesions appear on the face. and in 75% of the confirmed cases, the palms, soles, and oral mucous membranes are affected. however, for genitalia and conjunctivae, it is 30% and 20%, respectively. mucosal lesions in the mouth emerge 1 to 2 days later, followed by skin lesions on the face and extremities, which are centrifugally condensed. the rash may or may not transmit to other body parts, and the lesions can range from a few to thousands of numbers. the lesions progress via vesicular, macular, papular, and pustular phases during the next two to four weeks in one- to two-day increments. lesions are hard, deep-seated, 2 to 10 mm in size, and alter synchronously. before crusts form, lesions are in the pustular phase for five to seven days. crusts develop and desquamate within the next seven to fourteen days, and the condition often cures three to four weeks from the symptom onset. after all the crusts have fallen away, the patient is no longer regarded as contagious. 6. current epidemiology between 1980 and 1985, 282 cases were documented in zaire at the time of initial human identification. the average fatality rate in unvaccinated cases was 11%, with higher rates in children, while no mortality was found in patients who had received vaccinations. after the mpox outbreak in the us in 2003, the first case of mpox this year in a nonendemic country was confirmed on may 6, 2022. a british person who had visited lagos and delta states in nigeria, where mpox is regarded as an endemic disease, reported a case of mpox in early may 2022. on april 29, while in nigeria, the person acquired a rash and traveled back to the uk, arriving on may 4 and presenting to the hospital that day. the mpox was suspected quickly; thus, the patient was admitted to a hospital and isolated before testing positive for mpxv on may 6, 2022. the uk health security agency reported two new cases of mpox on may 12, both in london. the ukhsa confirmed four more cases of mpox on may 17 in 3 londoners and one individual from north east england. on the same day, the uk health secretary sajid javid announced that 11 other cases had been confirmed, which brings the total number of patients in the country to twenty. through the second part of may 2022, new cases in numerous countries beyond the endemic region were recorded. portugal reported 14 cases of mpox on may 18. till may 18, there were seven cases confirmed in spain. the us verified its first case of mpox in 2022 on the same day, while canada reported thirteen suspected cases. on may 19, sweden, belgium, and italy confirmed their first cases. france, australia, germany, and the netherlands verified their first cases on may 20. several european countries, as well as israel, verified their first cases in may. mexico and the united arab emirates confirmed their first cases. dr. sue hopkins, the uk health security agency's top medical advisor, reported on may 23, 2022, that 37 new mpox cases had been verified, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the uk to 57. beginning on may 18, cases started to be reported from an increasing number of countries and areas, especially europe, north and south america, north africa, asia, and australia. following the international health regulations, 780 laboratory-confirmed cases had been notified to who by 27 nonendemic nations in four who regions as of june 2, 2022. by october 31, 2022, confirmed mpox cases had increased to 77,092, and the total number of deaths was 36. between august and october 2022, 57 hospitalized patients with severe mpox symptoms received clinical consultation from the centers for disease control and prevention. following the “2022 mpox outbreak” released by who on january 16, 2023, mpox cases were reported in 110 countries. as of january 16, 2023, there were 84,716 confirmed cases; the us had the most cases with 29,980. since then, 80 fatalities have been reported worldwide; the top nations are the us, brazil, peru, nigeria, mexico, ghana, spain, and cameroon. the who's most recent updates indicate that the global risk of mpox is moderate. regarding geographic distribution, the risk is highest in the americas and moderate in africa, the eastern mediterranean, europe, and southeast asia. from july 2023 to august 2023, 1020 new cases were reported from the united states of america, europe, and the western pacific. that means a 1.2% increase is seen in total cases of mpox. also, three new deaths were reported, all in the usa. as of 11th september 2023, among the cases with available data, 96.3% were males. the median age of these cases was 34 years, with an interquartile range of 29 to 41 years. notably, the age and sex distributions of the cases have remained consistent over time. 7. monkeypox in immunocompromised patients immunocompromised individuals, including those undergoing cancer treatments, organ transplants, or afflicted with autoimmune disorders, are particularly susceptible to severe manifestations of the mpxv. a cdc study illustrated the graveness of this issue, showing that a significant number of hospitalized patients with mpxv were immunocompromised. these patients presented with extensive skin lesions, and a concerning 21% who were treated in intensive care units succumbed to the disease. the severity of mpxv in these individuals is further highlighted by two case reports: one of a patient undergoing chemotherapy for hodgkin's lymphoma and the other a kidney transplant recipient. both patients presented with severe symptoms, though the lymphoma patient experienced a more aggressive disease progression. despite over 80,000 globally diagnosed cases of mpxv, there is a notable absence of data from randomized controlled trials on antiviral treatments. mpxv in immunocompromised patients often presents with extensive rashes, possible secondary infections, and complications like respiratory issues and organ dysfunction. these severe manifestations emphasize the need for more comprehensive research and targeted treatment approaches for this vulnerable population. 8. vaccination mpxv infection is usually mild; most infected people recover for a few weeks without therapy. a recent study demonstrated that vaccination did not lead to a reversal in the occurrence of mpox. different countries are already utilizing vaccines to manage mpox outbreaks. currently, there are three smallpox vaccinations in the strategic national stockpile of the us: the apsv or aventis pasteur smallpox vaccine could be used to treat smallpox as part of an investigational new drug protocol, along with jynneostm and acam2000®, which are licensed for smallpox. the jynneostm was accepted by the us food and drug administration in september 2019 and is now suggested for preventing smallpox and mpox diseases for persons of 18 years or older who have been shown to have a high risk for smallpox or mpox infection. jynneos, a replication-deficient mva vaccine, protects adults from developing smallpox or mpox. according to historical statistics, smallpox vaccination with the vaccinia virus was around 85% effective against the mpxv. the cdc has an emergency access ind protocol that allows the use of acam2000® during an outbreak for infections caused by nonvariola orthopoxviruses. it was accepted by the fda in august 2007 and replaced the earlier orthopoxvirus vaccine, the dryvax®. between jynneostm and acam2000®, there are several distinctions. acam2000® is a vaccinia virus capable of reproduction, whereas jynneostm is a modified vaccinia ankara virus incapable of replication. because of this, acam2000®, but not jynneostm, causes a significant cutaneous reaction at the inoculation site. as a result, using acam2000® carries a danger of accidental inoculation and autoinoculation. however, using jynneostm has no such risk. by contrasting immunologic reactions and “take” rates between acam2000® and dryvax, the fda evaluated the efficacy of acam2000®. similarly, the fda evaluated the effectiveness of jynneostm by contrasting its immunologic response to that of acam2000® and considering supportive animal research. avoiding acam2000® in populations is legitimate because recommendations state that immunosuppressed people should not use it. additionally, the unintentional transmission that results in fetal vaccinia can be lethal to the fetus or baby and can happen when using replication-competent vaccines. other severe adverse reactions found more commonly with acam2000® than with jynneostm are post-vaccination encephalitis and myopericarditis, which are estimated to affect 5.7 per 1000 main acam2000® vaccine recipients. when approved vaccinations are unavailable or inappropriate, the replication-competent vaccinia vaccine, apsv, may be used under emergency use authorization or an ind. bavarian nordic vaccines are considered safe for at-risk categories since they are made of a modified type of the vaccinia virus. an emerging approach to control the spread of infectious diseases like mpox is the ring vaccination strategy. this involves vaccinating immediate contacts of a confirmed infected individual, forming a protective “ring” of immunity around the infected person to break the chain of transmission. this strategy has been particularly effective in isolated communities, ensuring efficient resource utilization and limiting the spread of the disease. however, challenges arise in tracing and vaccinating certain contacts, especially in societies where there's stigma attached to behaviors such as msm. this makes the tracing of these cases and their contacts potentially difficult, jeopardizing the effectiveness of the ring vaccination strategy. additionally, logistical barriers in some regions and public hesitancy towards vaccination, due to potential rare adverse events, further underscore the need for comprehensive public awareness campaigns. it is difficult to say whether giving the vaccination after someone has been exposed to mpox can entirely protect them because it takes between five and twenty-one days for someone who comes into close contact with an infected individual to display signs of mpox and most often, seven to fourteen days. studies indicate the acceptance of mpox vaccine's prevalence of 58.5% among healthcare workers, with 41.5% demonstrating vaccine refusal. geographic disparities exist with asian and african regions showing higher acceptance compared to north america and europe. acceptance is notably high among physicians alone. higher acceptance in asian and african regions may stem from factors like greater mpox knowledge within china due to government outreach and potentially poorer understanding within the us compared to china. a similar geographic pattern existed for covid-19 vaccine acceptance, suggesting a broader trend. cultural, religious, and local factors, coupled with rampant misinformation, all contribute to vaccine hesitancy, as seen with the covid-19 pandemic. continuous monitoring and strategies to combat misinformation are crucial for improving vaccination rates. 9. antiviral drugs various drugs could be used to treat mpox. one such medicine is tecovirimat, which works by interfering with a protein located on the surface of orthopoxviruses to inhibit infection from spreading. another antiviral that could be used is cidofovir, an injectable medicine approved in the uk to treat a deadly viral eye infection in people with aids. cidofovir is transformed into the antiviral component cidofovir diphosphate in the body. cidofovir prevents smallpox in the lab; it could be approved for use in smallpox or mpox outbreaks in the future. however, cidofovir is a powerful drug that might harm the kidneys; a better choice would be brincidofovir, a similarly related drug approved in the us to treat smallpox. in humans, brincidofovir has been evaluated for various viral infections. laboratory investigation proving that it acts against orthopoxviruses led to its approval for treatment in smallpox in the us. as a result, brincidofovir is also included as a possible treatment for mpox. however, data on cidofovir, brincidofovir, and tecovirimat in treating human mpox infections must be included. 10. approaches for prevention and control while health experts believe that the concerns for the general population are low, the united kingdom's national health service, the united states centers for disease control and prevention, and the world health organization all recommend taking certain actions to limit the risks of catching the virus. when feasible, anyone with large lesions that cannot be covered easily, respiratory symptoms, or draining or weeping lesions should be separated in a room away from others in the family and pets. the mpox patients should stay home until they visit the doctor for follow-up care. visitors must have compelling reasons to visit the doctor. members of the household who are not sick should avoid contact with the monkeypox patient. animals, especially pets, should be avoided by those with monkeypox. pets should be cared for by other household members whenever possible. patients with respiratory symptoms should wear a surgical mask. if not possible, other family members should wear a surgical mask near the monkeypox patient. disposable gloves should be worn for direct contact with lesions and discarded after that. cover up skin lesions as much as possible to reduce the danger of contact with infected persons. after contact with lesion material, clothes, environmental surfaces, or linens that may have come in contact with a lesion, sick people and household contacts should disinfect their hands with soap or use an alcohol-based sanitizer. laundry can be cleaned using warm water and soap in a regular washing machine; bleach can be added but is not required. soiled laundry should be handled in any way that does not cause infectious particles to disperse. the sick person does not need to use separate utensils if thoroughly washed. the utensils should be washed using warm water. surfaces that have been contaminated should be cleaned using some good quality disinfectants. it is common for healthcare workers to come into contact with patients who have mpox. not only mpox lesions be present in nontypical ways but also misidentifying them raises the possibility of professional encounters without the appropriate personal protective equipment. also, exposed healthcare personnel should be kept under active supervision for 21 days to cover the incubation period. additionally, outpatient settings should be offered in high-risk mpox transmission areas with suitable ppe, gloves, fluid-repellent surgical facemasks, eye protection, and ffp3 respirators for personnel. interestingly, postexposure vaccinations with the existing variola vaccines can be given to the exposed person. it should be given within four days to fourteen days after exposure. moreover, all healthcare personnel should get a proper idea of mpox and its symptoms through emergency training courses to increase their understanding and attitude toward mpox outbreak response and prevention. 11. conclusions the re-emergence of monkeypox underscores a critical concern for global health, potentially heralding the onset of a future pandemic. contemporary evidence suggests that a decline in human immunity may have set the stage for the resurgence of this virus. recent detections of mpxv cases beyond africa accentuate the potential for its geographical spread and underline the global implications of this disease. it is imperative that public health communities recognize the escalating risk posed by mpox and prioritize efforts to mitigate its spread. healthcare practitioners attending to affected patients must exercise meticulous caution to curtail human-to-human transmission. the exigent need of the hour is the rapid development and deployment of mpxv-specific antiviral agents and vaccines. initiating vaccination campaigns in regions with confirmed mpxv presence, particularly africa, is paramount. additionally, substantial international funding should be mobilized to bolster case detection and surveillance efforts globally. to navigate the evolving landscape of mpox epidemiology, rigorous research endeavors are essential. comprehensive understanding and awareness are our foremost tools in preempting and managing potential mpxv outbreaks. collaborative efforts, spearheaded by organizations like who and augmented by the influential reach of social media, can amplify global awareness. by harnessing informed strategies and fostering international collaboration, we can proactively counteract the looming threat of a mpxv-induced pandemic.
molecular epidemiology, transmission and clinical features of 2022‐mpox outbreak: a systematic review abstract background and aims the 2022‐mpox outbreak has spread worldwide in a short time. integrated knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and transmission of mpox are limited. this systematic review of peer‐reviewed articles and gray literature was conducted to shed light on the epidemiology, clinical features, and transmission of 2022‐mpox outbreak. methods we identified 45 peer‐reviewed manuscripts for data analysis. the standards of the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta‐analysis statement and cochrane collaboration were followed for conducting the study. results the case number of mpox has increased about 100 times worldwide. about 99% of the cases in 2022 outbreak was from non‐endemic regions. men were mostly infected with homosexual and bisexual behavior. the ages of the infected people ranged between 30 and 40 years. the presence of hiv and sexually transmitted infections among 30%–60% of cases were reported. human‐to‐human transmission via direct contact and different body fluids were involved in the majority of the cases. lesions in genitals, perianal, and anogenital areas were more prevalent. unusually, pharyngitis and proctitis were more common during 2022 outbreak than pre‐2022 outbreaks. brincidofovir is approved for the treatment of smallpox by fda. two vaccines, including jynneostm and acam2000®, are approved and used for pre‐ and post‐prophylaxis in cases. about 100% of the cases in non‐endemic regions were associated with isolates of iib clade with a divergence of 0.0018–0.0035. isolates from b.1 lineage were the most predominant followed by b.1.2 and b.1.10. conclusion this study will add integrated knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical features, and transmission of mpox. introduction the 2022 mpox outbreak has transmitted across 110 countries with case number surpassing 86,716 on march 29, 2023.

3 historically, monkeypox virus was isolated in 1958 from outbreaks in cynomolgus monkeys with smallpox‐like symptoms in copenhagen.
3,
4,
5 during 1970s, several outbreaks were reported from monkeys in the united states and the netherlands. the first symptomatic case of human mpox was documented in 1970 during smallpox surveillance in democratic republic of congo from a 9‐month‐old child followed by another six cases in young children during 1970–1971 in west africa.

5 before the ongoing 2022 outbreak, mpox was considered a rare zoonotic disease.
4 monkeypox virus is a double‐stranded dna virus belonging to the family poxviridae, subfamily chordopoxvirinae, and genus orthopoxvirus.
6 the genus includes other important pathogens of humans and animals, including mpox, cowpox, camelpox, vaccinia, and the smallpox. symptomatic infection of monkeypox virus results in smallpox‐like symptoms in patients. further, monkeypox and smallpox viruses are highly similar both in genetic and antigenic properties.
6,
7 the genome of monkeypox virus is about 200 kb in size, linear, and contains hairpin ends with inverted terminal repeats. nearly 200 proteins are encoded by mpox virus. housekeeping genes are encoded from the central conserved regions. antigenic proteins are encoded by the terminal regions of the genome and vary between poxviruses.
6,
7 the animal reservoirs of zoonotic monkeypox virus are still unknown. further, the intermediate hosts of monkeypox virus are also unknown.
4,
6,
7 apes and monkeys are the most likely intermediate hosts and several rodent species, including tree squirrels, rope squirrels, gambian pouched rats, and dormice, are the most probable animal reservoir of monkeypox virus.
4 the natural history of monkeypox virus is yet to be discovered. based on the findings of previous sporadic and recent 2022 outbreaks, the transmission route of monkeypox virus can be characterized.

27,
28,
29 severe illnesses and other complications like encephalitis, pneumonitis, and secondary infections are higher in children, elderly, and hiv‐infected patients.
23,
25,
27,
29 the discontinuation of routine vaccination of smallpox since 1980 and asymptomatic circulation of monkeypox virus in humans may have contributed significantly to changes of biological properties of the virus.
4,
6,
7 further, changes in human behaviors and movement have probably contributed to the 2022 outbreaks. studies on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and transmission route are scarce. only few review studies are available with limited knowledge of the previous sporadic outbreaks.
4,

7 recently, as case numbers are increasing, studies focusing on clinical features and transmission are getting highlighted to understand the baseline of the outbreaks. this study was conducted to create integrated insights about the epidemiology, route of transmission in the human body and environment along with clinical data of monkeypox virus. methods definitions the epidemiology of mpox is defined as the distribution and determinants of outbreaks in different populations and strategies taken to minimize the health effect in different population. the clinical feature was defined, including both the signs and symptoms during and after the mpox infection. transmission of monkeypox virus was defined as the transfer of the virus from human to human, reservoirs to human, and carrier to human. this study included epidemiological, clinical, and virological studies. the pcr‐positive laboratory‐confirmed test was defined as the positive mpox case. the standards of the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta‐analysis statement and cochrane collaboration were followed for conducting the study.
30 the study is submitted for registration in the prospero. study design the study was conducted by the following different steps, including identification of precise objectives and search strategies, appropriate research articles, inclusion of manuscripts, collection of data, analysis, and summarization of the findings. this study included previous findings from epidemiological studies, case studies, outbreak investigation, surveillance work, and online databases. no strict parameters for the quality assessment of these studies are available. as a result, this study relied on the quality report of the selected articles by the authors. search strategy and selection criteria we performed searches for articles in medline, embase, web of science, scopus, the internet library sub‐saharan africa, african journals online, the new england journal of medicine and the lancet with no restriction on language and place. all published articles and scientific writings till march 20, 2023 were included in this study. the notable search term included monkeypox, monkeypox virus, monkey pox, mpxv, epidemiology of mpox, epidemiology of monkeypox, clinical features of monkeypox, sign and symptoms of monkeypox, clinical characteristics of mpox, cases of monkeypox, transmission of mpox, transmission of monkeypox, “variole simienne,” and “variole du singe” and combination of these terms. separate searches were made for each term in every website and database. additionally, we conducted search on the gray literature and google scholar. these sources included databases from cdc, ecdc, who, epicentre, promed, cdc of nigeria, cdc of africa, and african field epidemiology network. we searched for the weekly and monthly updates on the emergencies and update of the data in these websites and databases. further, we searched and included data from different preprint databases like biorxiv, ssrn, medrxiv, and aas open research. additionally, the first 10 pages of the google scholar search system for each search term were manually analyzed for relevant articles. we tried to determine the epidemiology of mpox, including transmission dynamics, incidence, case reports, clinical history, case fatality rate, and distribution of clades. further, we included data identifying the risk factors and risk groups of mpox. two authors, n. s. and s. k. d. conducted the evaluation of eligible studies. after completion of the search of all the databases, the potential articles were selected by removing the duplicates and screening by n. s. and k. j. a. articles with specific and relevant topics were selected for all regions, all ethnicity, age group, sex, and clinical features for full‐text analyzing. we also included the articles focusing on the transmission of mpox involving animals and humans to better understand the mode of transmission. we excluded modelling and prediction studies, studies on smallpox, review articles, and studies nonrelevant to our objectives. further, critical evaluation of the quality of selected articles, analyzing for duplicated articles, and removing correspondence or comment of duplicated data were performed by n. s., s. k. d., and k. a. j. separately. the seasonal exclusion criteria could not be implemented due to lack of studies on seasonality and environmental impacts. furthermore, we could not exclude studies that did not include data on specific clades due to a lack of work. we used the systematic review centre for laboratory animal experimentation assessment tool for measuring the risk of bias.
31,
32 the syrcle consists of 10 parameters to assess different biases in studies. the parameters included detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, selection bias, performance bias, and other biases. the bias for each parameter was measured by using the possible outcomes as yes, no, and unclear, representing low, high, and unclear bias, respectively.
31,
32 case definition a confirmed case of monkeypox virus was defined by following the uk health security agency definition: a positive result on mpox pcr assay in a specimen collected from any anatomical site is considered as a positive case. the type of the used pcr assay will be determined on the basis of local guidelines and availability of the test method. statistical analysis a total number of cases was determined for each decade by summation of the reported cases per clade. pooled statistical analyses were conducted by using sas version 9.4. results studies included this study detected 12,032 research articles on epidemiology and transmission of monkeypox virus and previously mentioned related search terms. among 12,032 articles, 453 articles were screened and considered eligible for further full‐text investigation. the excluded articles were duplicate, reviews, correspondence, editorial, and failed to have inclusion criteria. after analyzing the full texts, only 66 studies were found to be eligible for further analysis. based on the inclusion criteria, 45 of 66 manuscripts were finally selected. among the selected manuscripts, we extracted epidemiological data from 30 articles, transmission data from 33 articles, clinical symptoms from 18 articles, and treatment and prevention from 9 articles. we also extracted data from two databases, including cdc and ecdc. epidemiologic features of 2022‐mpox outbreaks as of march 29, 2023, a total of 86,716 cases of monkeypox virus had been documented in 110 countries worldwide. nearly, 99% of cases were reported from non‐endemic regions.

45 after the first report, drc remained the most affected country with documented confirmed and probable cases of mpox.
4 after 1970s, the confirmed cases increased in drc by many folds in every decade.
35,
36,
37 documented confirmed probable or possible mpox cases were 38 during 1970–1979, 343 in 1980–1989, 511 in 1990–1999, and suspected cases were about 10,000 in 2000–2009 and 20,000 in 2010–2019.

35,
36,
37,
39,
41,

22,
46 about 47 confirmed cases were reported linked to infected gambian pouched rats from ghana.
4,
22,
46 after that report, no case of monkeypox virus was documented for more than 15 years. recently in 2018, the first case of monkeypox virus in the united kingdom was documented followed by one case in israel in 2018, one case in 2019 in singapore, three cases in united kingdom, and one case in the united states in 2021.

47,
48,
49 starting in the last quarter of 2017, the outbreak continued through 2022 and 558 confirmed cases were documented with a case fatality ratio of 3.5% from 32 states of nigeria.

47,
48,
49 probable under‐reporting of monkeypox virus has occurred during 2020 to 2022 due to covid‐19 pandemic. clade distribution of monkeypox virus three distinct clades of monkeypox virus have been defined, namely i, iia, and iib by happi et al.
51 two accepted nomenclatures of genome of monkeypox virus had been reported, namely hmpxv1 focusing on the human‐to‐human transmissible recent isolates after 2017 outbreaks and monkeypox virus including broad diversity of viruses from the discovery till now.
51,
52,
53 in the phylogenetic analysis of monkeypox virus, it was documented that isolates from clade iib were associated with 2022‐outbreak. the tree included 700 genome and mpxv‐m5312_hm12_rivers was used as the reference sequence. calculated average divergence of clade iib was between 0.0015 and 0.0020.
53,
54,
55 data from about 1400 whole genome were included for hmpxv1. all of the whole‐genome sequences of hmpxv1 are from the clade iia. about 27 lineages have been identified based on the genetic divergence till december 2023.

55 predominance of lineage b.1 is evident followed by b.1.2, b.1.10, b.1.1, b.1.7, b.1.3, a, b.1.4, b.1.11, and b.1.17, respectively. the tree was built by using the maximum composite likelihood model and mpxv‐m5312_hm12_rivers was used as the reference sequence. from the phylogenetic tree we can see that isolates from lineage b.1 and subsequent lineages were more common in europe, north america, and south america during 2017 to march 2023. after the 2022‐mpox outbreak, the spread of isolates from lineage b.1 and related lineages including b.1.2, b.1.10, b.1.1, and b.1.3 occurred rapidly in europe and north america. these data may represent partial diversity as the sequencing of large number of cases is ongoing. recently evolving lineages of hmpxv1 have an estimated evolutionary rate of ~6 × 10−5 subs per site per year. the highest divergence that was calculated for the circulation lineages was 0.00035. the ongoing pandemic isolates of b.1 lineage and associated segregated lineages have a strong evolutionary relationship with the isolates of 2017–2019 outbreaks in nigeria.
52,
53,
54,
55 the isolates of b.1 lineage and their descendants have evolved and acquired successful human‐to‐human transmission capability. though the natural history of 2022 mpox pandemic is not well understood, it has several characteristic features than the previous mpox endemic cases, outbreaks, and sporadic cases. the most notable epidemiological features of newly evolved isolates include a defined risk group, namely msm, sexual transmission, and increased median age than previous outbreaks. the pandemic lineages have probably undergone genetic evolution before the onset of the first case of the ongoing pandemic in the first quarter of 2022 and acquired more changes in the genome through human‐to‐human transmission. extensive studies are required to determine the relationship of evolutionary changes with the newly identified pandemic characteristics. transmission of mpox virus during outbreaks transmission of mpox virus has been occurring since 1960s in the nonhuman primates. evidence of animal‐to‐animal transmission both in the natural environment and laboratory is well documented.

60 the natural history of mpox virus is yet to be understood well. in the endemic areas, the zoonotic transmission was the most prominent source of human infection. however, over time the evidence of animal‐to‐human and human‐to‐human transmission increased in africa. close contact with the lesions and body fluids of diseased animals during different activities like deforestation, hunting, slaughtering, and butchering contributed to interspecies transmission of animal‐to‐human infection. further, animals like rodents get infected when they come in contact with lesions or body fluids of diseased humans. however, virological confirmation is lacking in central and west african countries on the interspecies transmission of mpox virus. the cessation of smallpox vaccination since 1980s contributed to the wanning of cross‐protection against monkeypox virus.
4 human‐to‐human transmission of monkeypox virus has been reported in both central and west african countries.

60 contact with skin lesions and fluids of indexed patients among the family members and healthcare providers was the most attributed risk of transmission of monkeypox virus. contaminated fomites, bedding, and clothing also contributed to the transmission.

60 sexual transmission of monkeypox virus before the 2022 outbreak was not prominent. human‐to‐human transmission in both clade i and clade ii was documented before the 2022‐mpox pandemic in the endemic regions of africa. the growth was estimated below 1 both for the clade i and clade ii in endemic and pandemic cases. traveler cases were mostly reported from clade ii and the virus was carried outside the endemic areas. limited evidence on transmission chains support smaller clusters of infection from the indexed patient can occur. as the ongoing outbreak involves the largest number of human cases, the knowledge of the diversity of transmission continues to evolve. majority of the studies reported evidence of sexual activities for transmission of monkeypox virus in non‐endemic regions in 2022. the clinical, epidemiological, and virological findings strongly support the sexual transmission of monkeypox virus from indexed patients to susceptible persons. direct contact with the lesions especially on the skin of the genital, anus, anorectum, and throat of patients during sexual activities contributed to the transmission of monkeypox virus among the people.

29 transmission of monkeypox virus in people after sexual activities with presymptomatic patients has been documented. however, transmission from asymptomatic patients is not reported yet. virological data on several studies have documented infectious monkeypox virus in semen in patients. recent studies have reported a higher prevalence and concentration of mpox dna in semen samples of the infected men.

27 however, these are preliminary studies to define and characterize the transmission of monkeypox virus via semen. we have also analyzed several studies reporting early evidence of droplet transmission of monkeypox virus via the respiratory route. nosocomial infection among the healthcare providers has been documented. transmission via sharp instruments, piercing, and tattooing have also been documented.

62 there is limited evidence on the fomite transmission of monkeypox virus via contaminated surfaces and objects. however, the potential of contamination of different household objects by monkeypox virus should be evaluated in detail. studies have documented the presence of infectious monkeypox virus on lesions and major secretions, including urine, feces, nasal or oral droplets and conjunctival exudates in humans and animals.

60 during 2022‐outbreak the probable route of transmission included direct contact, ingestion, and inhalation. pre‐2022 mpox outbreaks and sporadic cases have transmitted to humans via bites from infected animals, contact with lesions or fluids and blood of infected organs, and aerosols.

58,
60 no confirmed sexual transmission was reported before 2022 outbreak.
4 both animal and person‐to‐person transmission were reported from pre‐2022 outbreaks. however, during 2022 outbreak person‐to‐person transmission became the major source of transmission. it is unlikely that person‐to‐person transmission can maintain the virus in humans for a longer period. besides human‐to‐human transmission, monkeypox virus has been reported among a diverse group of animals.

66 nonhuman primates in both the wild environment including chimpanzees and monkeys of genera cercopithecus and captivities including captive gorillas, gibbons, asian orangutans, chimpanzees, marmosets, siamiri and macaca have been documented with clinical infection of mpox.

66 in 2003, a larger outbreak of monkeypox virus started from gambian giant pouched rats and transmitted to different animals like north american black‐tailed prairie dogs, groundhog/woodchuck, dormice, rope squirrels, jerboa, and opossums in the united states. with greater genetic divergence, isolates of clade i were mainly involved in the infection of nonhuman primates in central african regions. further, isolates of clade iia were transmitted to diverse groups of animals in west africa and outside endemic regions, including europe and the united states.

66 the reservoir of mpox viruses is still undermined. small mammals or rodents in africa are thought to be reservoirs. probably, clade i and clade ii are maintained in different animal species. clinical manifestations of patients with monkeypox virus associated with 2022 outbreak monkeypox virus‐infected patients have reported several characteristic clinical symptoms. majority of the recent studies have documented symptomatic infections.

29 treatment and prevention of mpox virus infected people until now there has been no specific medicine or treatment option available against mpox infection.
72 drugs used in the treatment of smallpox can be used for special cases of mpox.
72,
73,
74,
75,
76,
77,
78,
79 however, the safety and efficacy of tecovirimat in treating people with monkeypox virus is not well‐studied and the food and drug administration and cdc have not approved the drug as a treatment option.
75,
76 in severe cases, only tecovirimat is approved to be used with proper concern of the patients. only the healthcare provider will decide where to use tecovirimat. other antivirals, including brincidofovir and cidofovir, have also been used in several conditions of mpox infection. cidofovir, fda approved injection‐based antiviral against cytomegalovirus infection.
72,
73,
74,
75,
76 recently, it has been used to treat patients with monkeypox virus. the specific effects of cidofovir on the outcome of monkeypox virus need to be studied in detail. cidofovir is also not approved for use in treating mpox by fda or cdc. brincidofovir is an oral formulation of cidofovir. it is already approved for the treatment of smallpox by fda. however, a limited number of studies have reported the effectiveness of brincidofovir against mpox infection. in animal models, brincidofovir has also provided effectiveness against orthopoxvirus infections also.
74,
75,
77,
78,
79 however, the specific effectiveness and side effects of these antivirals in mpox patients need to be evaluated in more detail. termination of smallpox vaccination contributed toward the uprise of monkeypox virus cases. the available smallpox vaccine is successful to provide about 85% protection.
4,
73,
74,
75 the smallpox vaccine provides good cross‐protection against mpox infection. for the prevention of mpox, vaccines, including jynneostm and acam2000®, are approved and used for pre‐ and post‐prophylaxis in specific patients. jynneostm is a 2‐dose vaccine.
75 for vaccinations with jynneostm, a list of recommendation from cdc, usa should be followed. another vaccine called aventis pasteur smallpox vaccine is also authorized for emergency purposes where the other two vaccines are unavailable or restricted for use.

75 discussion mpox outbreak during 2022 became one of the major public health threats.

3 this systematic review integrated epidemiological, clinical, and transmission data of 2022 outbreak of mpox. we used a structured format of data analysis and provided a real‐world overview of mpox outbreak. beginning from the early 2022, the cases of monkeypox virus started to increase rapidly.
1,
2,
3 this is one of the first systematic reviews reporting human‐to‐human transmission of monkeypox virus involving about 90,000 people in 110 regions. in mpox history, it is the largest known outbreak. local transmission of mpox involving large number of cases in non‐endemic regions has never been documented before 2022 outbreak. about 99% cases were reported from these non‐endemic regions.
1,
2,
3,
5 the highest number of cases was reported in the americas and eu/eea regions, which is the first time in the history of monkeypox virus. the majority of the cases have been documented in the united states, followed by brazil, spain, france, and colombia, respectively. however, before this 2022 outbreak cases of monkeypox virus have never exceeded 50 in these countries.
1,
2,
3,
4 there are several reasons behind this dramatic outbreak of monkeypox virus in the non‐endemic regions. first of all, waning of mass immunity against smallpox has contributed toward the larger outbreak of monkeypox virus. vaccines against smallpox are effective in providing protection against monkeypox virus. second, genetic changes and evolution of monkeypox virus may have contributed to the changing epidemiology. finally, the unaware acts, including lack of knowledge of the mode of transmission of monkeypox virus, involvement in sexual activities of the infected people without proper protection, and traveling, have also contributed to massive spread of monkeypox virus during 2022 outbreak, which is supported by previous studies.
4,
36,
37,
38,
41,
46 this 2022‐mpox outbreak may be a sign of a larger pandemic of mopox in the future. without proper investigation and epidemiological analysis, it will be difficult to prevent mpox outbreaks in the future. majority of the studies have reported characteristic epidemiological pattern of 2022‐mpox outbreak distinguished from sporadic cases and local outbreaks reported during the last 50 years in african countries. the majority of the cases were reported among men.

29 further, the age of the infected was also distinct from pre‐2022 outbreaks and cases. most of the cases were reported in people aged between 30 and 40 years, which is a new characteristic of 2022 outbreak. in previous outbreaks in central and west african countries most of the cases were reported in people aged below 20 years or among young children.
4,
33,
34 our analysis finds that a continuous increase in the median age of infected people is occurring. during 1970–1989, mpox was primarily reported among children aged 4 to 5 years, during 2000–2009 among people aged 10 years and during 2010–2019 among people aged 21 years.
4,
33,
36,
38,
42,
45,
49,
50 the majority of the deaths associated with monkeypox virus were also reported among children aged below 10 years before 2010. however, after 2010 the death rate has shifted swiftly to people aged greater than 20 years. this study suggests that epidemiological changes in mpox outbreaks have been ongoing with consistent changes since 2010. however, majority of the studies on pre‐2022 outbreaks have documented animals as the primary source of monkeypox virus transmission and human‐to‐human cases were rare. during the 2022‐outbreak we detect that majority of the cases were human‐to‐human transmitted.
9,
11,
13,
14,
15,
16,
18,
21,
24,
29 these epidemiological changes are probably the result of genetic changes of the virus and origin of strains with altered properties and changes in human behaviors. among the methods of transmission, direct contact with lesions, body fluids, nonliving objects contaminated with monkeypox virus and droplets contributed to the majority of the cases.

27 specifically, msm got infected from their partner through direct contact during sexual activities. majority of the cases were reported by msm men during 2022‐mpox outbreak. however, none of the pre‐2022 studies have reported about the high prevalence of monkeypox virus among msm men.

46,
47,
48,
49 another major characteristic of this outbreak was the presence of previous sexually transmitted diseases, including hiv, syphilis, and gonorrhea among the monkeypox virus cases. about 30%–50% of the cases had previous records of hiv‐positive health conditions. these findings are fully supported by the published original research and systematic articles.

15,

29 however, studies on the correlation between the presence of hiv and other stis with monkeypox virus are limited and fail to determine their health impact. characteristic clinical presentations of monkeypox virus cases in 2022 outbreak were different from previous outbreaks and sporadic cases. the majority of the lesions were unevenly distributed in the genitals, perianal, anogenital, trunk, and forearm regions of the patients.

29 further, report of fever, weakness, pharyngitis, and proctitis were more common during 2022 outbreak than pre‐2022 outbreaks. majority of the cases were reported in the outpatient ward in this outbreak, which was inpatient for pre‐2022 outbreaks. this study documented that monkeypox virus from clades i, iia, and iib were involved in previous outbreaks depending on the geographic regions. however, during the 2022 outbreak, 100% of the isolates were from clade iib with divergence of 0.0018–0.0035. about 26 lineages of clade iib evolved and transmitted during 2022 outbreak. in the united states and europe, isolates from b.1 lineage were the most predominant, followed by b.1.2 and b.1.10. monkeypox virus variants from clade iib were involved in the majority of the cases and responsible for distinct epidemiological features from pre‐2022 outbreaks. as more human‐to‐human transmission occur the changes in the genome accelerated.
4,
53,
54,
55,
56,
57 lineage i and iia were confined to the majority of the cases in central africa and west africa, respectively. however, emergence of the new west african lineage, iib, was involved with large number of cases outside africa and in 2022 outbreak. before 2022 outbreak, isolates from lineage iia were capable of infecting a large number of wild animals, laboratory animals, and from animal to humans.
4,
46 though the natural history of monkeypox virus is not fully known, it is predicted that without the animal host, monkeypox virus cannot continue its infection cycle for a longer period in humans alone. however, isolates from iib have several distinct epidemiological and clinical characteristics. newer transmission routes of monkeypox virus have been identified during 2022 outbreak, which contributed to the larger community outbreak.

60 for treatment and prevention, no drug or vaccine is approved against monkeypox virus. however, vaccination against smallpox has a good protective effect against monkeypox virus and can be used in specific situations. the main strength of this study is the using of bias free approach to integrate the findings. this study included well‐defined terms and broad search strategy on mpox without the limit of language, time, and place. in addition, a wide source of information, including gray literature, was also analyzed. however, this study has few limitations. a lower number of actual cases may be presented due to lack of active and proper surveillance. lack of studies on asymptomatic cases might have influenced the transmission characterization. conclusion the reduction of immunity against smallpox due to discontinuation of vaccination has contributed to the reappearance of monkeypox virus. evolution of lineage iib with great capacity to spread from human‐to‐human has impact on the larger outbreak of mpox in the nonendemic regions. we documented distinct epidemiological, clinical, and transmission properties of monkeypox virus during 2022 outbreak. this study reported that men aged 30–40 years with specific sexual behavior contributed to majority of the infected people. furthermore, household transmission and human‐to‐human transmission were two main sources of community outbreak. we also detected that distinct clinical feature included appearance of lesions on the genitals, anogenital, perianal, and trunk were common. this study provided an integrated insight into the epidemiology, clinical features, evolution, and transmission of monkeypox virus. author contributions nadim sharif: conceptualization; data curation; formal analysis; investigation; methodology; resources; software; validation; writing—original draft; writing—review & editing. nazmul sharif: data curation; formal analysis; project administration; writing—original draft. khalid j. alzahrani: methodology; writing—original draft. ibrahim f. halawani: formal analysis; writing—review & editing. fuad m. alzahrani: software; writing—review & editing. isabel de la torre díez: software; writing—review & editing. vivían lipari: data curation; validation. miguel angel lópez flores: formal analysis; writing—review & editing. anowar khasru parvez: formal analysis; writing—review & editing. shuvra kanti dey: data curation; resources; supervision; validation. conflict of interest statement the authors declare no conflict of interest. ethics statement this study was ethically approved by the biosafety, biosecurity & ethical committee of jahangirnagar university. transparency statement the lead author nadim sharif affirms that this manuscript is an honest, accurate, and transparent account of the study being reported; that no important aspects of the study have been omitted; and that any discrepancies from the study as planned have been explained.
