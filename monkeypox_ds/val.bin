nsed by European Union (Luo and Han, 2022).

JYNNEOS (Imvamune or Imvanex) was approved by FDA in September 2019 for prevention of smallpox and mpox in adults aged >18years (Alakunle et al., 2020). JYNNEOS is the brand name of Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) vaccine (Kmiec and Kirchhoff, 2022), a non-replicating third-generation attenuated vaccine. JYNNEOS is considered safer (with proven efficacy in animals and humans) than ACAM2000™ (Sah et al., 2022a). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended JYNNEOS as an alternative to ACAM2000™ (Harapan et al., 2022). Nonetheless, both vaccines (JYNNEOS and ACAM2000™) have been recommended for MPXV high-risk groups (Petersen et al., 2022).

LC16m8 is another potential vaccine for MPXV which is obtained by subjecting VACV lister to 36 serial passages at low temperature (30°C) in primary rabbit kidney cells (Domán et al., 2022; Poland et al., 2022; Schnierle, 2022). As a third-generation attenuated vaccine (Gessain et al., 2022), LC16m8 has been shown to be protective against MPXV in animal models with lower neurotoxicity (Domán et al., 2022; Schnierle, 2022). The frameshift mutation in LC16m8’s major extracellular enveloped virion antigen (B5R) contributes to the vaccine replication competence and low virulence (Domán et al., 2022). Presently, LC16m8 is only licensed in Japan (Domán et al., 2022; Schnierle, 2022).

ANTIVIRALS

Although there are no specific antivirals for mpox, some antivirals (tecovirimat, brincidofovir, cidofovir) have been explored (Riopelle et al., 2022). Tecovirimat (ST-246 or TPOXX®), 4-trifluoromethylphenol derivative, was approved (for smallpox) by FDA in 2018 and approved by European Medicines Agency in January 2022 for treatment of smallpox and cowpox. Tecovirimat inhibits VP37 (p37) protein of VACV by targeting the viral F13L gene (Frenois-Veyrat et al., 2022) and the CPXV homolog V016 gene (Siegrist and Sassine, 2022). VP37, a highly conserved protein in OPXV genus, is required for viral maturation and release from the infected cell. Inhibition of VP37 prevents viral spread within an infected animal models (Rizk et al., 2022). Goyal etal. recommended tecovirimat to be administered as first line of mpox treatment in pregnant and breastfeeding patients (Goyal et al., 2022). A tecovirimat analogue (synthesized by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, Russia) has been highlighted as a promising antivirals against OPXV infections (Singhal et al., 2022).

Cidofovir (CDV or Vistide®) prodrug is an acyclic nucleoside phosphate (Alakunle et al., 2020) that was approved by FDA in 1996 for the treatment of retinitis (caused by cytomegalovirus) in AIDS patients (Harapan et al., 2022). The efficacy of CDV has been identified during the in vitro studies in MPXV-infected animals, but the clinical data of CDV efficacy against mpox in human are not available. Brincidofovir (CMX001 or hexadecyloxypropyl-cidofovir), a CDV derivative, was approved for smallpox treatment in 2021 by FDA, and it has lesser toxic effects than CDV (Ortiz-Saavedra et al., 2022). Evaluation of CMX001 efficacy and safety in human mpox through the clinical trials is needed (Ortiz-Saavedra et al., 2022; Siegrist and Sassine, 2022).

BIOSAFETY, BIOSECURITY AND BIOETHICS

RECOMBINATION WITH VACCINIA VIRUS AND OTHER OPXV

Due to inadequate genome surveillance data particularly in endemic regions, little information about MPXV recombination is available (Yeh et al., 2022). However, there are some evidences of recombination between coinfecting or superinfecting OPXVs both in a laboratory setting and in nature (Estep et al., 2011; Goff et al., 2011; Brennan et al., 2022; Diaz-Cánova et al., 2022b, 2022a; Gigante et al., 2022).

MPXV circulating in non-endemic regions where other OPXVs are endemic, for instance, CPXV in Europe and VACV-like in south America, and vaccination against mpox with JYNNEOUS or ACAM 2000 are scenarios for coinfection and superinfection between different species of OPXV. Thus, there remains a potential risk of recombination between MPXV and other OPXVs that may result in MPXVs with mosaic genomes and altered biological characteristics.

DUAL USE AND BIOTERRORISM

Although there is insufficient evidence of MPXV being used for bioterrorism at the moment (Hosseini-Shokouh et al., 2022), many scientists have expressed concerns over its potential use for bioterrorism because there is a report that there was an attempt by the former Soviet Union to use MPXV as a bioweapon (Nalca et al., 2005; Duraffour et al., 2007; Kindrachuk et al., 2012; Hosseini-Shokouh et al., 2022; Makkar, 2022). The possibility of MPXV as a potential bioweapon due to its global reemergence and its clinical similarities with VARV has placed the virus on the global public health agenda (Ellis et al., 2012; Ihekweazu et al., 2020). For example, the USA has made preparation for the possibility of smallpox virus as a potential bioterror biological by storing smallpox vaccines and antivirals after the 9/11 attack (Franz, 2004; Xiang and White, 2022). Smallpox virus is in category A of the CDC list of bioterrorism agents (Hosseini-Shokouh et al., 2022). The risk of bioterrorism is heightened knowing that MPXV genomes can be synthesized from publicly available sequence data and life viruses (with or without further genetic modification) can be re-constituted. This has already been demonstrated with horsepox virus (HPXV), which shares the same genus as MPXV (Noyce et al., 2018). Hence, a strict dual-use policy must be agreed upon and implemented in all laboratories across the globe.

STIGMATIZATION AND VACCINE INEQUITY

Sexual orientation (especially LGBQTI+ community) (Sousa et al., 2022) and racial (Happi et al., 2022) are two stigmas associated with MPXV. The persistent narrative of the media alongside many scientists linking the mpox 2022 outbreak to Africa/West Africa/Nigeria is worrisome (Sousa et al., 2022). Despite the mpox 2022 outbreak, which occurred outside Africa, the nomenclature and the geographical labels of MPXV strains still reference West African, even though the origin of this outbreak is still unresolved. Furthermore, high mpox cases were reported among MSM (Happi et al., 2022; Malta et al., 2022; Sousa et al., 2022; Sah et al., 2022b). This narrative portrays these men contracting MPXV because they engaged in sexual intercourse with fellow men, meanwhile the spread of the virus can occur regardless the sex. Vaccine inequality affects lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs). An unknown number of mpox cases in LMICs are not captured due to a shortage of resources like limited testing and surveillance capacity (Malta et al., 2022). As highlighted by Malta et al., the MPXV vaccines are presently accessible only in high-income countries (Canada, the USA, and the UK) (Malta et al., 2022).

CONCLUSION

MPXV has emerged and re-emerged for over five decades and yet not much is known about its virological profile and the characteristics of the disease it causes. In particular, the reservoir host of MPXV remains unknown, the viral, host and environmental factors that modulate the virus maintenance in the wild, animal-to-animal transmission, zoonotic transmission and reverse spillover are still a mystery. Neither are we closer to reliable prognostication of virus emergence and accurate modelling of the disease outcomes. Current and future studies should prioritize understanding the molecular basis of MPXV infection to develop effective drugs and vaccines against mpox as well as functional mutational studies that will shed insight into the dynamics of MPXV transmission across hosts. To improve tracking of MPXV, laboratories particularly in resource-poor countries should be equipped with genome-based surveillance capacity and capability. Lastly, MPXV and mpox affect human, animal, and ecosystem health. Thus, a One Health strategy is indispensable to the prevention and treatment of current and future outbreaks.

Insights into the Transmission, Host Range, Genomics, Vaccination, and Current Epidemiology of the Monkeypox Virus

Abstract

This review delves into the historical context, current epidemiological landscape, genomics, and pathobiology of monkeypox virus (MPXV). Furthermore, it elucidates the present vaccination status and strategies to curb the spread of monkeypox. Monkeypox, caused by the Orthopoxvirus known as MPXV, is a zoonotic ailment. MPXV can be transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets during prolonged face-to-face interactions. While many cases of monkeypox are self-limiting, vulnerable groups such as young children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals may experience severe manifestations. Diagnosis predominantly relies on clinical presentations, complemented by laboratory techniques like RT-PCR. Although treatment is often not required, severe cases necessitate antiviral medications like tecovirimat, cidofovir, and brincidofovir. Vaccination, particularly using the smallpox vaccine, has proven instrumental in outbreak control, exhibiting an efficacy of at least 85% against mpox as evidenced by data from Africa. Mitigating transmission requires measures like wearing surgical masks, adequately covering skin lesions, and avoiding handling wild animals.

1. INTRODUCTION

Monkeypox, commonly referred to as “mpox,” is a reemerging zoonotic condition characterized by symptoms reminiscent of smallpox in humans and certain animals, caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently transitioned to using “mpox” over the traditional term “monkeypox” [1, 2]. MPXV, a double-stranded DNA virus, falls within the Orthopoxvirus genus of the Poxviridae family, sharing this category with other human-pathogenic species such as vaccinia, variola, and cowpox [3]. While the major variola virus, responsible for Asian smallpox, boasts a fatality rate between 20% and 45%, its attenuated counterpart, variola minor or alastrim, sees rates between 1% and 2% [4]. MPXV shares close genetic and clinical ties with the variola virus; however, mpox typically presents milder symptoms than smallpox [5]. In unvaccinated populations, mpox can exhibit fatality rates up to 10%. Research conducted with about 1800 cases of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo showed that individuals unvaccinated against smallpox had a 2.73- and 9.64-fold higher chance of contracting mpox in comparison to those vaccinated against smallpox. Other studies conducted in the USA (United States of America) and Spain similarly demonstrated a higher risk of contracting mpox among unvaccinated individuals compared to those who had received the smallpox vaccine [6, 7]. The virus manifests in two distinct subtypes: clade I and clade II, previously associated with the geographic domains of the Congo Basin and West Africa, respectively [8]. While both clades can induce significant illness, they often resolve without intervention. The West African clade's mortality rate stands below 4%, whereas the Congo Basin variant can escalate to 10% [9, 10]. Mpox poses specific risks to children and can lead to complications like congenital mpox or stillbirth during pregnancy [10, 11]. The disease's nomenclature stems from its 1958 discovery, following two outbreaks mimicking pox in research monkeys. The inaugural human mpox case was detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 1970 [12]. Since then, human cases of mpox have been verified in multiple countries, including Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Liberia, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo, and Sierra Leone [13]. The majority of cases have been reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo [14, 15].

In 2003, the US (United States) experienced an outbreak of mpox [16, 17]. Over the past several decades, there has been a tenfold increase in the number of monkeypox (mpox) cases. Notably, the median age of affected individuals has shifted from young children, approximately 4 years old in the 1970s, to young adults with a median age of 21 years during the period from 2010 to 2019 [18]. This epidemiological shift might be attributed to the discontinuation of smallpox vaccinations, which historically provided some degree of cross-protection against mpox. Despite being identified 70 years ago, mpox has often been overlooked in medical literature, primarily due to its perception as a rare and self-resolving condition [19, 20]. On May 6, 2022, an outbreak of mpox was identified, originating from a British individual who contracted the illness during a visit to Nigeria, a country where the disease is endemic [21]. By October 31, 2022, the disease had spread to over 100 countries, resulting in 77,092 confirmed cases across nations like Australia, the UK (United Kingdom), the US, and various European countries [22]. By early September 2023, the tally of laboratory-confirmed mpox cases had risen to 89,752 [2]. Cases outside Africa have largely been linked to international travel or the importation of animals [23]. The CDC indicates that while the primary reservoir of the mpox virus remains unidentified, it is believed that African rodents and certain nonhuman primates, such as monkeys, might transmit the virus to humans [24].

The escalating number of individuals affected by MPXV necessitates an in-depth examination. This review aims to shed light on the multifaceted dimensions of the recent mpox surge. It provides an updated account of the history and present state of the MPXV disease, delving into its modes of transmission, current epidemiological landscape, and pathobiology, with a particular focus on the virus's genomic makeup. Moreover, this study presents an overview of the antiviral medications and vaccines available for the treatment and containment of MPXV infections.

2. HISTORY

In 1958, the renowned Danish virologist Preben von Magnus, recognized for his contributions to polio vaccines, influenza, and mpox research, identified mpox in cynomolgus monkeys within a Danish laboratory setting [12]. This discovery followed two outbreaks resembling smallpox in monkey colonies, originally from Malaysia, which were later transported to Singapore [12]. By 1964, another mpox outbreak was noted at the Rotterdam Zoo, and soon after, instances of the disease were identified in laboratory monkeys within the US [12]. After 1968, incidents of mpox in laboratory monkeys declined, attributed to enhanced living conditions for the animals and a reduced demand for monkeys from Asia and Africa, primarily used in polio vaccine production. The presence of the virus in Asian monkeys, despite the virus not being native to Asia, likely resulted from contamination or infections acquired during captivity or transit. Historically, mpox was often misdiagnosed as smallpox, chickenpox, shingles, and herpes [25]. However, as the severity and outbreak potential of mpox became evident, accurate diagnosis grew in importance [1]. The inaugural documented human case of mpox appeared in 1970, afflicting an unvaccinated infant, just nine months old, in the Équateur Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Intriguingly, this occurrence was post the eradication of smallpox in the region in 1968 [26]. Since the initial identification of monkeypox (mpox), the majority of human cases have predominantly originated from the rural rainforest regions of the Congo Basin, especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The disease has been documented across central and west Africa. From 1970 onwards, mpox cases have emerged in 11 African countries, including Benin, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Gabon, Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Republic of Congo, and South Sudan. During the decade from 1970 to 1979, approximately 50 cases were reported, with the Democratic Republic of Congo accounting for over two-thirds of these instances [27]. Other countries, such as Liberia, Sierra Leone, the Ivory Coast, and Nigeria, also reported cases during this period [28]. Subsequently, since 1986, over 400 human cases have been recorded [28]. It is noteworthy that in tropical central and West Africa, sporadic viral outbreaks often occur, characterized by a 10% mortality rate and a 10% rate of secondary human-to-human transmission [13]. The most significant mpox outbreak was observed between February 1996 and February 1997 in these regions [12]. Outside Africa, the first significant outbreak in the US occurred in 2003. This outbreak was linked to human contact with infected pet prairie dogs, which were housed with Gambian pouched rats and dormice imported from Ghana [12]. Following an outbreak, over 70 instances of monkeypox (mpox) were recorded in the US [29]. Subsequent cases of mpox were identified in travelers from Nigeria to various countries: Israel in September 2018, Singapore in May 2019, the UK in December 2019, and the US in July and November 2021, as well as May 2021 and May 2022 [30]. Remarkably, in May 2022, mpox cases emerged in several countries where the disease was previously nonendemic [30]. The World Health Organization (WHO) data indicate that from January 2022 to September 2023, mpox was reported across 114 countries/territories/areas, with a total of 89,752 laboratory-confirmed cases. Tragically, 157 of these cases resulted in fatalities attributed to MPXV [2].

3. TRANSMISSION, HOST, AND ZOONOSIS

The specified method by which MPXV spreads to humans is unknown. However, when handling MPXV-infected animals, primary animal-to-human infection is thought to happen (Figure 1) [31]. Animal-to-human (zoonotic) transmission may occur through direct (touch, bite, or scratch) or indirect contact with the blood, body fluids, cutaneous lesions, or mucosal lesions of infected animals [32]. The virus enters the body through skin breaks, some of which are not apparent, as well as the eyes, mouth, nose, and other regions of the respiratory tract. Although MPXV's reservoir host (primary disease carrier) is unknown, African rodents are thought to be involved in transmission [32]. Many African animals are infected with the MPXV, including tree squirrels, Gambian pouched rats, rope squirrels, dormice, and monkey species [32]. Eating undercooked meat and other animal-derived products from diseased animals can be a possible risk factor. People living in or close to forested areas may be indirectly or minimally exposed to infected animals [33]. The mpox outbreak in 2003 in the US began when prairie dogs in a pet shop were presumed to have been infected with the MPXV by a large Gambian rat native to Africa [34, 35]. The disease then spread through pet prairie dogs, infecting 70 people [34].

Also, secondary or human-to-human transmission is considered common [24]. Although human-to-human transmission is common, prior mpox outbreaks remained small and self-limiting because many people in the past have had some immunity (known as “cross-immunity”) from the late 20th-century smallpox mass vaccination programs. Once the at-risk population developed immunity and local herd immunity was attained, the outbreak swiftly ended. The prevalence of mpox cases in May and June 2022 points to new transmission clusters from big gatherings, such as raves and festivals [36]. Human-to-human transmission can happen when people come into close contact with infected persons' skin sores, respiratory secretions, or recently contaminated objects [24]. Also, it can be transferred by touching a mpox-infected patient's clothing, bedding, or towels and through coughs and sneezes [37, 38]. Large respiratory droplets are assumed to be the primary method of human-to-human transmission [39]. And after transmission from infected animals or humans, mpox infection begins with dermal or respiratory epithelial infection. Recently, prolonged mpox DNA shedding from the upper respiratory tract following skin lesion resolution has been observed. Therefore, there is a risk of mpox infection for those who are in close proximity to the patient during an aerosol-generating procedure (such as intubation) and are not using a surgical face mask or respirator [40]. Long-term face-to-face contact is required since respiratory droplets can only travel a few feet [38]. However, in the past few years, the number of person-to-person infections in the longest-known chain of transmission in a community increased from six to nine [41], which could be related to the loss of immunity in all groups due to the end of smallpox vaccination. Also, transmission can happen by the placenta from the mother to the fetus (might cause congenital mpox) or between and after birth through intimate contact. There have also been reports of transmission through tattoos, piercings, and sharp instruments [42]. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia's Norwich School of Medicine, said that “Transmission of monkeypox seems to be almost exclusively being transmitted by close and intimate contact. So, people should avoid contact with people who could be infected, especially if they have a rash. Also, the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo showed that the virus circulated quickly through households [41]. The mpox is generally not a sexually transmitted disease, yet it can be transferred by direct touch during sex [43]. The MSM community (men who have sex with men) is most affected by the current mpox outbreak [43], which does not indicate that we are dealing with a new mpox strain that only affects men or is sexually transmitted between men [44]. World Health Organization (WHO) also stated that everyone with intimate contact with an infectious person is at risk of contracting mpox [44]. Recently, in the enzootic areas, mpox was detected in teenagers too. And according to WHO, serious mpox cases were found in children and are correlated with the level of virus interaction [45].

This outbreak was the first documented occurrence of mpox community transmission outside of Africa and the first known case of transmission between men who have sex with men (MSM) [44]. Before the outbreak in 2022, mpox was not considered an STD (sexually transmitted disease) [41]. The virus's rapid spread between sexual partners in the initial stages of the outbreak led to speculation that sexual intercourse could be a different mode of transmission [43]. According to epidemiologist David Heymann, mpox was likely to spread sexually among MSM in two waves in Spain and Belgium in 2022, which started the European outbreak [43]. Additionally, the CDC reevaluated recent outbreaks for potential transmissions, including kissing, hugging, oral, anal, and vaginal sex. These transmissions may be connected to genetic modifications facilitating the MPXV's human-to-human transmission [46]. The primary risk factors for monkeypox virus (MPXV) transmission are summarized in Table 1.

4. GENOMICS

The monkeypox virus (MPXV or MPV) belongs to the Poxviridae family, the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily, and the Orthopoxvirus genus [47]. The MPXV seems huge under electron microscopy (200–250 nanometers) [48]. Poxviruses are brick-shaped, and a lipoprotein envelope surrounds their linear double-stranded DNA genome [48]. Poxviruses have all the necessary assembly, replication, transcription, and egress proteins in their genome despite their mRNA translation's dependency on host ribosomes [47–49]. MPXV, cowpox virus (CPXV), variola virus (VARV), and vaccinia virus are among the many viruses in the Poxviridae family, Orthopoxvirus genus that have been observed to infect humans. Although genetically and antigenically similar, orthopoxviruses vary in host range and pathogenicity features. According to comparative genomics studies, Orthopoxvirus evolution is proceeding and can be influenced by a host species' selection pressure [12, 26, 50–52]. It has been suggested that the evolution of these viruses was driven by progressive gene loss, particularly toward the ends of the genome [53]. MPXV has a 197 kb linear DNA genome with 190 nonoverlapping ORFs greater than 180 nt. Like all orthopoxviruses, MPXV's main coding region sequence (CRS) at nucleotide positions 56,000–120,
