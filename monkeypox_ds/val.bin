enced mild to severe symptoms of disease yet still survived, unlike those animals that received dna fragments and could survive. similarly, some studies concomitantly used both dna and protein-based vaccines and received good results in the form of lower symptom rates and disease resolution within a few days. immune system incitation in the form of antibody production against b-cell-conserved epitopes of mpox was also observed in these animals. moreover, experiments have also been conducted to check the impact of passive immunization by the transfer of vaccinia-neutralizing antibodies which demonstrated effective immune system responses in receiving animals. all these studies need to be further checked, and confirmation on human models is the next step to officially obtain a licensed vaccine against mpox. at present, only the approved vaccination is being used for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis in high-risk individuals. the risk attached to the immune escape, viral mutation, and other strains of orthopox viruses make it imperative to work continuously on alternative vaccines specified against mpox. 3.7. a brief account of approved vaccines two approved vaccines, jynneostm and acam2000®, are currently being utilized for pre- and post-prophylaxis in specific patients. these vaccines are not readily available and are limited to some endemic regions and most developed countries for precautionary use against mpox-reported cases. apart from these two vaccines, another vaccine, aventis pasteur smallpox vaccine, is authorized for emergency purposes in case the other two vaccines are not available or contradicted for application. some characteristic features of both approved vaccines are shown in table 1, and a brief account of other vaccine trials is summarized in table 2 below. 3.8. antiviral therapeutics against mpox the smallpox viruses caused havoc back in its pandemic times and is still considered a bioweapon for its associated lethality and infectivity. owing to the similar nature of monkeypox viruses, scientists are putting a lot of effort to propose rigorous drugs against mpox. the suggested drugs are undergoing approval stages, and some are being used for the supportive care of patients. problems associated with vaccination restriction compel the healthcare authorities to heavily rely on these supportive drugs and antiviral agents in case of treatment urgency. moreover, the disease cases which already developed symptomology of mpox vaccine remain ineffective for reducing the symptoms, and thus drugs come into play. the three most common drugs that are being utilized against mpox are named cidofovir, brincidofovir, and tecovirimat. a brief account of these drugs is discussed below. 3.9. cidofovir against mpox this is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent which acts to terminate dna polymerase-based replication in the form of 5′-diphosphorylated metabolite and thus is effective against a wide range of dna viruses. it has proven to be efficacious against viral infections such as hiv, vaccinia, mpox, smallpox, etc.. the main routes of administration include topical and intravenous administration. the best feature of this antiviral agent is that it decreases the symptomology to avert lesions formation and reduces mortality rates. it is used as a second-line therapy for severe vaccinia. specifically, in the case of mpox, the trials have demonstrated reversed mpox by inhibiting mpox replication. however, it has been reported to cause nephrotoxicity during intravenous administration and thus requires probenecid and hydration and proper dose adjustment with renal functional considerations to deal with nephrotoxicity. moreover, more clinical experimentation is required on mpox cases in humans. 3.10. brincidofovir against mpox brincidofovir functions by phosphorylation to its active metabolic form “cidofovir diphosphate”. it selectively inhibits activity against orthopox dna polymerase and thus has proven effective against dna viruses. it is also known as a lipid conjugate of cidofovir and is considered to be a cidofovir diphosphate prodrug. lipid acylic nucleoside phosphonate works as a phospholipid in the body and lessens lesion formation with no proven impact with coupled vaccination. in some cases, reports demonstrated complete recovery of patients with minimal side effects. thus, it received approval against cytomegalovirus retinitis in hiv patients and received approval for smallpox and related infections in 2021. it is preferred for rapid and widespread administration in cases of emergency outbreaks. unlike cidofovir, it has good oral bioavailability and no reported nephrotoxicity; therefore, it is approved for oral administration. however, the liver enzymatic profile must be carefully regulated, and functional tests must be conducted for the application. additionally, due to hyperactive drug accumulation, it not recommended for immunocompromised patients, pregnant women, and newborns. recently animal experimentation against mpox reported effective treatment, but it requires more clinical experiments for proper approval and licensure. 3.11. tecovirimat - against mpox this was licensed in 2018 for smallpox and in 2022 for mpox. it functions to inhibit viral egress by targeting a unique gene that produces the m37 envelope protein required for viral maturation and release. it has reported high efficacy against orthopoxvirsues by reducing viral replication pace and viral load. moreover, it causes delayed viral infection onset and decreases lesion formation and thus causes reduced infection symptomology and mortality rates. repeated experiments have well established its safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profiles. it showed concomitant immunological effects in coupled vaccination experiments. however, the issue of drug resistance development is there, and no teratogenicity has been predicted in pregnant women. specifically for mpox, it has been checked in humans but lacks randomized phase 3 trials and thus needs further experimentation. 3.12. vaccinia immune globulin against mpox this was licensed in 2018 against vaccinia virus infections. it acts as an alternative to antiviral agents. its derivatives, recombinant immunoglobulins, are under investigation. rvigs work on a strategic passive immunotherapy approach. the candidate’s plasma-derived vaccinia immunoglobulins, vigiv cangene and vigiv dynport, are under investigation and are not licensed yet. it has been used successfully in refractive cases. as a hyperimmune globulin, it functions to neutralize virus particles and reduces viremia and mortality rates by up to 30–40%. antibodies are collected from the plasma of smallpox-immune individuals to create passive immunity. it has been redistricted for application in immunodeficient individuals as it contains amounts of maltose that possibly affect glycemic conditions and insulin levels, may interfere with serological testing, needs caution for renal insufficient profiles, and increases revaccination needs. there are a lack of human testing data against mpox and thus needs further investigation. apart from these three antiviral agents, some other important drug candidates under trial against mpox are summarized in table 3. note that a detailed explanation of these trials can be traced in the referenced publications since a detailed analysis of these studies is beyond scope of this review article. 3.13. future directions for antiviral therapies against mpox as progress in the field of biotechnology increases, more effort is being put forward to propose novel therapeutic approaches against emerging infectious diseases. knowing the scope of current targeted therapy approaches such as those based on micrornas and silencing rnas, there is work happening to find accurate targeted molecules against mpox. similarly, biomarker-based therapies are also in research annals as biomarkers offer an effective targeting and flexible drug design approach against different kind of diseases. for viral diseases, the biobased approaches allow effective screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and mitigative vaccination and adaptive treatment measures. moreover, by integrating the in silico and bioinformatic statistical and molecular models with biomarker-based theory, more sophisticated therapies could be formulated with fewer side effects, better delivery, reduced resistance potential, and improved pharmacokinetic properties. the next step in the development of better antivirals against infectious diseases such as mpox includes the discovery of better cellular targets, innovative drug-targeting strategies, and improved drug delivery mechanisms. important drug targets and biobased markers tested in different studies are part of table 3. most of these biomarkers have been proposed while keeping in consideration the genomic similarities between smallpox and mpox, which sets a trace route for future therapies. another important development that is predictive to develop better treatment options for mpox in the future includes nanotechnology-based therapies. specifically, silver nanoparticles have been investigated for their proven antimicrobial properties. agnps are being utilized to decrease the infectivity of mpox in different studies. nanotechnology-based therapies offer novel, inexpensive, and broad-spectrum treatment options against different diseases. the basic principle is to alter the properties of present and newer antivirals at the nanoscale to improve their physiochemical features and linked pharmaceutical properties. another approach is the conjugation of nanoparticles with the approved drugs to improve the effectiveness, targeted delivery, and improved drug delivery to the body. specific studies of agnps against mpox have exhibited their dose-dependent inhibitory effect. however, more studies are needed to prove the research implication in clinical models. 4. conclusions complex and exaggerating burdens have been imposed on the healthcare system owing to the covid-19 pandemic and converging outbreaks of various other viral infections at the same time including ebola, dengue, and mpox. under these pressurized conditions, the scientific community is rigorously working to produce an effective therapy against mpox and other infectious diseases. though there is effective work being conducted in the field of vaccination and drug design, the current developments are still considered theoretical because most of the drugs are for diseases of smallpox origin. therefore, more effort should be kept on modern therapeutic options to specify them against mpox. there is a need to coordinate their efforts with an integrated approach with the medical industry for clinical experimentation. the recommendations from healthcare authorities have been properly outlined, and treatment recommendations and vaccination protocols have also been formulated against specific groups of the workforce and susceptible persons. thus, a coordinated and participatory approach will be needed to educate the community and general public in awareness programs regarding mitigation, adaptation, and disease management before the epidemic of mpox becomes another pandemic of the century.
mpox: an emerging or re-emerging infection with a potential colossal burden on healthcare globally abstract the world health organization identified mpox, as a resurgent zoonotic epidemic caused by the mpox virus. it is an emerging and re-emerging pathogen with a range of hosts and geographical distribution worldwide. peer-reviewed scientific articles from 1958 to 29 august 2024 related to global mpox research were extracted from web of sciencetm core collection and google scholar databases to gauge the extent of the infection. mpox is marked by a recent resurgence of infections across continents, with africa being the hardest-hit region. the mpox re-emergence has shown a new mechanism of transmission, with several causes such as a rise in the number of unvaccinated individuals, behaviour risk factors, waning immunity, genetic evolution, and environmental circumstances. preventive and control measures of mpox include vaccination and patient isolation, while treatment involves antivirals and antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections. laboratory diagnosis entailing polymerase chain reaction can be effective for routine purposes, but results of serological tests must be interpreted with caution, because of cross-reacting determinants among orthopoxviruses. the structure and classification of the mpox virus, clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, epidemiology, historical antecedent, therapeutics, vaccines, and laboratory diagnosis of the disease are explicated, showcasing mpox as an emerging or re-emerging infection with a potential colossal burden on healthcare, and its classification as an international public health emergency by the world health organization. what this study adds this review provides the global situation of mpox as an emerging or re-emerging infection, warranting its designation as an international public health emergency. introduction mpox, formerly known as monkeypox by the world health organization, is a zoonotic viral infection with a cycle of transmission involving the active participation of wild animals.1 the mpox virus is regarded as both an emerging and a re-emerging pathogen with a varied range of hosts.2 the re-emergence of the mpox virus version with enhanced virulence since its first identification and reporting in monkeys in 1958 is favoured by the alterations in the virus genome resulting from mutations.2 although mpox was identified 70 years ago, it has been ignored in medical literature because of its rarity.3 however, it has recently been accorded much attention because of a trail of morbidity and mortality in different age groups worldwide, although its foci were mainly in africa.2,4 the mpox name is likely to have originated from the fact that mpox was initially identified in monkeys from singapore used for research purposes in 1958 and then transported to copenhagen in denmark.3,5,6 mpox is caused by a diverse and large group of orthopoxviruses7 and is characterised by symptoms that resonate with those of smallpox and chickenpox, even though mpox usually presents milder symptoms compared to smallpox and has a 10% fatality rate in people who are not vaccinated against smallpox.3 mpox is a viral disease that has been added to the who list of communicable diseases by viruses with the possibility for widespread and epidemic repercussions and fears after the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, hence its classification as an international public health emergency.8,9,10 by 29 august 2024, a total of 89 596 established cases of mpox had been recorded across 114 countries, with 157 deaths,11 resulting in apprehension regarding the geographic spread.12 even though the exact causes and reasons for the re-emergence of mpox are unknown, it is postulated that it could be a result of several factors, such as the increase in the number of people not vaccinated against smallpox, risk factors of behaviours of men having sex with other men, decreasing immunity, genetic evolution, and ecological conditions.11 the global spread of the disease is a health hazard.13 additionally, the recent disease modelling proposes that pandemics which are usually caused by emerging diseases are expected to surge in severity and frequency in the upcoming decades.14 hence, the review aims to report on mpox as an emerging or re-emerging infection with a potential colossal burden on healthcare. methods on 29 august 2024, peer-reviewed scientific articles related to global mpox research were extracted from the web of sciencetm core collection and google scholar databases. the search included papers from 1958 to 29 august 2024, and included phrases associated with mpox, monkeypox virus, mpox classification and structure, mpox epidemiology, mpox vaccines, and mpox laboratory diagnosis. in every study that was retrieved, only english-language literature was included. classification and structure of the mpox virus classification of mpox virus the mpox virus belongs to the poxviridae family, which comprises 22 genera and 83 species.15 the family is subdivided into two subfamilies, namely chordopoxvirinae, with 52 species and 18 genera, and entomopoxvarinae, with 31 species and 4 genera. twelve members of the genus orthopoxvirus have been recognised to affect both humans and animals.15,16 the variola virus is the commonly known member that causes smallpox, while others are known as the cowpox virus, camelpox virus, skunkpox virus, volepox virus, taterapox virus, akhmeta virus, abatino macacapox virus, raccoonpox virus, vaccinia virus, ectromelia virus, and mpox virus.15,16 structure of mpox virus and its genome the lipoprotein outer membrane of the mpox enveloped virus is oval or brick-shaped.17 the normal size of the mpox virus varies from 200 nm to 250 nm, with a double-stranded dna genome of almost 197.2 kb, and encodes 181 proteins.18 the hairpin end of the linear genome is covalently closed and there are no free 3’ or 5’ ends.18 the genome ends consist of the 10 kb inverted terminal repeats and nucleotide homopolymers. however, short tandem repeats have been observed in the genome.18 orthologous poxvirus genes are closely packed, and intergenic areas that are 100 bp in length are uncommon.18,19 the ‘housekeeping’ proteins that are encoded by orthologous poxvirus genes in the conserved central area are responsible for transcription, replication, and virion processes. in the terminal domains, the proteins encoded by orthologous poxvirus genes are linked to the pathogenesis and host range.19,20 the mpox virus consists of two main clades: clade i, formally identified as the congo basin clade, and clade ii, formally recognised as the west africa clade.21,22 these clades are split into two subclades, namely clade ia and clade ib in clade i, and clade iia and clade iib in clade ii.21,22 lately, clade iii, consisting of hmpox-1 a, b.1, a.1.1, a.1, and a.2, has been reported in non-african countries, including mexico.22,23,24 clade iii varies primarily in regions of coding and is linked to the host’s recognition of antigenic determining factors and immune modulation.25 a total of 46 single-nucleotide polymorphisms are reported from clade iii.23,26 the mutation of mpox is because of the action of the apolipoprotein b mrna editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide 3 family of cytosine deaminases.27 pathogenesis and pathophysiology of mpox virus viral endocytosis, cell membrane fusion, and micropinocytosis accelerate viral transmission through oropharyngeal, subcutaneous, nasopharyngeal intramuscular, and intradermal pathways.28 the virus replicates at the location of inoculation, which leads to the virus spreading to different organs of the lymph nodes, blood, bone marrow, tonsils, and spleen, triggering inflammatory immune-mediated phagocytosis.29,30 this signifies the period of incubation, which usually lasts for 7 days to 21 days. through the guidance of the enveloped and mature virions, the genome and proteins of the mpox virus are discharged into host cells. intracellular mature virions encompassing the dna encoding the virus get generated when the virus mrna transcription and translation occurs.31,32 intracellular mature virions enfolded in the golgi apparatus fuse with the host inner cell membrane to form cell-related virions before being released into extracellular areas to produce extracellular enveloped virions.29 the mpox virus can be spread in different modes from animals to humans, or humans to humans. however, the general mode is through human contact with the bodily fluids of the infected animals.33,34,35 the distinction between mpox and smallpox is that mpox virus infection triggers lymphadenopathy in humans while smallpox does not. the early symptoms of mpox virus infection are muscle aches, headache, diarrhoea, fever, chills, vomiting, fatigue, and backache, which advance to fatigue, developing into secondary bacterial infections of the skin or blood and lung infections.21 the body of the infected person can be affected by lesions that are initiated in the oropharynx, and inflammation of the heart, brain or other organs can also occur.36,37 moreover, patients can also have neurological concerns in the form of encephalitis.36 the onset symptoms occur mostly in all age groups, although infants or the elderly might have a less frequent or different presentation of symptoms.21 epidemiology and historical outbreaks mpox virus was identified first in monkeys in 1958 during the occurrence of outbreaks in colonies of captive monkeys that were kept for purposes of research in a danish research institute, and has since evolved into a zoonotic infection affecting the human population.37,38,39,40 the first detection of mpox in a human host was discovered on 01 september 1970 in a baby in the democratic republic of the congo.38,39,40,41,42 since the campaign for worldwide smallpox vaccination gradually ended between the 1970s and 1980s, and smallpox was eventually eradicated by 1977, the number of human mpox cases in africa has been on the increase.43,44,45,46 the who verified a case of mpox later in 1980, and since then the virus has spread globally with a ten-fold increase in the past decades.38,39 in 1982, active mpox surveillance programmes were started in the democratic republic of the congo. this increased the number of detected cases. a high number of approximately 386 cases was observed in the democratic republic of the congo alone, whereas only 18 cases were observed in other endemic countries, with children being most affected.47,48 in 1986, mpox surveillance programmes in the democratic republic of the congo were terminated because of the onset of another epidemic, termed aids, in africa. this prompted the who to redirect its resources on public health.49,50 there was a decline in the number of confirmed human mpox cases in the decade that followed. no case was reported to the who beyond 1992. it was only in 1996 and 1997 that a cluster of 344 cases were reported in the democratic republic of the congo among a cohort predominantly unvaccinated against smallpox.51 since then, outbreaks have been common in the democratic republic of the congo. annually, over 1000 cases have been reported since 2005.44 in nigeria, there was a complete hiatus of cases for 39 years until 2017, when mpox re-emerged. a sizable country-wide outbreak of over 120 laboratory-confirmed or -suspected infections involving clade ii was then recorded.51 several factors, including population density, shifting patterns of land use, and declining herd immunity provided by smallpox vaccination were reported to be providing opportunities for more zoonotic transmission and outbreaks.51 in contrast, between 1970 and 2018, case reports of human mpox infection from other countries were infrequent.43,44 mpox re-emerged as a global outbreak in may 2022, with almost 86 000 cases and 53 deaths confirmed from 110 countries around the world, especially in areas where the disease had not been common.13 in 2023, there was an occurrence of mpox in the united states3 with 47 human cases that might be a result of close interaction with prairie dogs which were alleged to have been infected during a shipment imported from ghana.1 a recent outbreak was also reported in europe and africa, with suspected cases and total deaths recorded across different countries between 2022 and 2024. the african region experienced a surge in cases in july 2024. these data outline the outbreak trends across various geographical locations from 2022 to 2024.21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42 the geographical location and demographics revealed mpox occurrences mainly in central, east, and west africa, as well as multi-country outbreaks for clade iib, lineage b.1. demographics indicated morbidities of 70% and above, except for adults in burundi, across all clades and sub-clades, with a preponderance in men. sexual intercourse mode of transmission is reported to contribute more to the spread of the virus, especially by men who have sexual intercourse with other men.21 previously, the age of people infected with mpox ranged from 7 months to 40 years,47 where more than 80% of the mpox cases were seen in children under 10 years of age.47 the attributable deaths also occurred in children.47 the median age of the affected people moved from younger children of 4 years old in the 1970s to the median age of young adults of 21 years between 2010 and 2019.3 this could be because of the suspension of smallpox vaccinations which offered some form of herd immunity against mpox.3 however, recently in 2024, the age of people infected with mpox ranged from 0 years to 65 years, and men between 18 years and 44 years old continued to be excessively affected by the outbreak, accounting for 79.2% of reported cases, while women account for 3.6%. moreover, a rash is reported in 88% of cases with at least one reported symptom, and is thus the most common symptom.21 it was reported that the denotation of a symptom may differ throughout reporting systems in different countries as a result of a general lack of negative reporting and symptom classifications.21 management, potential therapeutics, and vaccines the treatment of mpox infections involves community-based and clinical measures to limit its spread.52,53 in community and clinical settings, patients should stay at home, and avoid contact with infected people, and healthcare professionals should follow guidelines to reduce the risk of infection.8,54 the guidelines include avoiding direct contact with skin lacerations, treating skin rashes with personal protective equipment, and wearing gloves.55 infected individuals should be isolated for approximately 2–4 weeks to decrease the spread of the virus and mitigate the impact of possible outbreaks.56 in addition, supportive care is essential for patients with limited antiviral therapies, including hydration, nutrition, symptomatic management, and antibiotic treatment.57,58,59 in immunocompromised patients, superinfection and eye infections can be managed with antibiotics.60 intensive care management and mechanical ventilation are often used for respiratory and neurological issues.61 potential antiviral agents new antiviral agents and vaccines such as cidofovir, brincidofovir, tecovirimat, immunoglobulin acam2000®, and jynneostm offer new therapeutic prospects for orthopoxviruses.62,63 smallpox, mpox, and cowpox share collective genetic similarities, which include shared surface proteins such as antibodies, and t-cell receptors.62 in addition, some smallpox vaccines create antibodies against a range of epitopes that bind to the shared epitopes of mpox proteins.63 the antiviral resistance of cidofovir is slow, affecting poxviruses through serial passage.63,64,65 it is effective in treating compound orthopoxvirus infections and is used in humans for poxvirus infections, molluscum contagiosum, and aids-associated cytomegalovirus retinitis.66,67 brincidofovir, a lipid-conjugated cidofovir analogue, was united states food and drug administration -approved in 2021 for smallpox therapy because of its comprehensive activity against double-stranded dna viruses and lower ec50 compared to cidofovir.68,69 its lipophilicity allows efficient entry into host cells and a prolonged intracellular half-life.69,70 oral brincidofovir has shown potential in treating poxvirus infections and pre-proactive therapy of adenovirus viraemia.71,72,73,74,75 tecovirimat, fda-approved in 2018, targets the v061 gene in cowpox and the membrane protein p37, which is responsible for extracellular enveloped virus formation.76,77 it is available in intravenous and oral forms and has no documented cross-resistance.78,79 it is effective in treating orthopoxviruses in animal models, preventing death, and reducing viral distribution to distant tissues.80 tecovirimat is used to treat orthopoxvirus infections in human patients because of its tolerance levels. four clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate its safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics.81 vaccinia immune globulin intravenous is an fda-approved immunoglobulin used to manage smallpox vaccination and adverse effects in skin disorders.82 it provides passive immunity but is not recommended for immunocompromised patients, diabetic renal complications, or sepsis history.83 clinicians may consider vaccinia immune globulin intravenous for complex mpox infections or t-cell immunodeficiency patients; however, live attenuated vaccines should be avoided 3 months after vaccination.84 vaccines and immunisations first-generation smallpox vaccines were effective, but adverse effects led to subsequent vaccine development.85 currently, three licensed mpox vaccines are available: modified vaccinia ankara-bn, lc16-kmb, and orthopoxvac.86 the fda has authorised acam2000 and jynneos for smallpox prevention and cross-protective immunity.87 the vacv can be treated with vaccinations, either before or after exposure.88 post-exposure prophylaxis should be administered 4 days or less after exposure, to prevent symptomatic infection.89 if mpox symptoms are absent, post-exposure prophylaxis can be administered up to 14 days after exposure. the fda authorised jynneos intradermal injection as a route of administration for emergency use in august 2022, in addition to the previously approved subcutaneous injection.90,91 the jynneos vaccine, approved by the fda for alternative use in mpox virus-infected persons, works by eliciting humoral and cellular immune responses.92 preclinical research indicates that mpox vaccination is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, although there is no preclinical research available for paediatric patients, despite being safe in immunocompromised people such as hiv patients.93 the acam2000 is a licensed vaccine for smallpox and mumps, given in single doses and lyophilised for long-term storage.93,94 it aims to balance the risk of pathogenic mpox with potential side effects from replicative vaccinations. furthermore, acam2000 is not recommended for hiv-positive patients since they have immunosuppressed systems, as it is a live vaccine that can cause severe complications. attenuated vacv, also known as modified vaccinia ankara, requires two injection treatments. live vacv immunisation has been linked to skin infections, premature delivery, congenital abnormalities, stillbirth, and perinatal mortality.94 however, vacv immunisation has a safer profile and fewer side effects compared to acam2000.95,96 healthcare professionals and laboratory people who are at a high risk of exposure are also evaluated for pre-exposure prophylaxis.84 world health organization guidelines on therapeutic interventions and vaccines for mpox pre-exposure immunisation for high-risk persons and post-exposure vaccination within 4–14 days is suggested by the who’s normative recommendations for mpox, to avoid or minimise the seriousness of the disease.21,90 vaccination should be used in combination with public health interventions such as contact tracing, isolation, and surveillance.10,21 target product profiles, which outline required vaccination qualities, have also been produced by the who.21,94,95 clinical administration places significance on supportive care related to medicine, and antivirals according to who guidelines.21,54,62,63 to ensure the reasonable allocation of vaccinations, treatments, and diagnostics, the who has also set up access and distribution processes, and has modified its recommendations in response to new information.21,50 laboratory diagnosis of mpox a critical factor in the diagnosis of infections, including the mpox virus, rests on laboratory diagnosis.96,97,98,99 two of the definitive methods for the laboratory diagnosis of mpox infection are the direct and indirect methods. for the indirect method, specimens collected are screened for the virus, the nucleic acid, or the viral antigens. to identify the dna, nucleic acid amplification testing is employed for the direct method. on the other hand, immune responses to the viral antigens form the basis for the detection using the indirect method.98 specimen collection, transport, and storage the main sample for laboratory diagnosis of mpox infection is the skin lesions, such as swabs from lesion exudate or lesion crusts. ideally, lesions, crusts, and vesicular fluids should not be placed in a similar tube, to obtain good dna or prevent inhibitors.97,98,99 oropharyngeal swabs, rectal or genital swabs, semen, or urine may be collected based on clinical manifestations.98,99 blood samples are also used, especially when treated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. this process may increase the concentration of the virus; however, it may not align with samples collected from lesions, as viraemia typically occurs during the early stages of infection or the prodromal phase. sample collection should be done by trained healthcare personnel in an appropriate clinical or field setting, using personal protective equipment, and then transported to laboratories with the appropriate level of biosafety for analysis.35,100 after collection of samples for laboratory diagnosis of mpox, samples should be placed in the fridge at 2 °c – 8 °c or kept chilled at –2 °c within an hour after collection, before transportation to the base laboratory. emphasis is usually placed on the storage and handling of specimens while being transported. if it is anticipated that it may exceed 7 days before processing of specimens following transportation, such samples must be stored at –20 °c or a lower temperature, or at –70 °c if storage will exceed 60 days after collection, to obviate false negative results caused by, for example, inability to extract dna.98,99 virus isolation the first isolate of the mpox virus was obtained in 1958 from cynomolgus monkeys using monkey kidney and human amnion cells.101 in humans, the virus was first isolated from a patient with a skin infection resembling smallpox. this was achieved by infecting pig embryo kidney cells, homo sapiens epithelial carcinoma cells, and african green monkey kidney cells, where cytopathic effects were observed.102 although research laboratories have employed culture-based techniques for the identification of the mpox virus, the routine identification of the virus is not recommended by the who as it is not only laborious, but has low sensitivity and takes some days, and must be performed using a biosafety level-3 safety chamber.97,98 electron microscopy the use of electron microscopy is a known method for identifying structures, including the fine details of the virus after isolation. this method reveals that the mpox virus has a brick-shaped or ovoid format, displaying intricate internal structures such as a double-stranded dna genome and enzymes. although electron microscopy is useful in revealing progeny virions in different phases of assembly, immature and mature ones, in infected cells, it is not recommended for routine laboratory diagnosis of the mpox virus.102,103,104 serological methods the use of serology to ascertain immune responses, immunoglobulin m and immunoglobulin g antibodies to mpox infection by use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, plaque reduction neutralisation test, complement fixation test, haemagglutination inhibition, and immunofluorescence are all of diagnostic value. however, results obtained should be interpreted with caution because of cross reactions or shared antigenic determinants among the orthopoxviruses or, in recent cases of vaccination, against smallpox.105,106 clinical laboratory findings and biomarkers to complement laboratory methods, variations of biochemical and haematological indices, such as thrombocytopenia, rated as the most common, hypoalbuminaemia, leucocytosis, and increased transaminase level are critical.1 other findings indicate that higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase may be related to poor prognosis. in addition, cytokine modulation has been reported to correlate with the severity of mpox in humans.107,108 the cytokines comprise interleukins 1b, 2r, 4-8, and 13, among others.98,108 the polymerase chain reaction test on lesions was, however, reported to give the highest clinical sensitivity, 91% – 100%,109,110,111,112 whereas the sensitivity of saliva, nasopharyngeal swab, and oral swabs was between 68% and 100%, seminal fluid was 78% – 100%,109,111 and rectal swabs were 78% – 97%.112 genome sequencing for epidemiological purposes or monitoring of transmission patterns as an adjunct to conventional laboratory analysis of mpox infection, whole genome dna sequencing is critical for observing differences in the viral genome over time. genome sequencing is not recommended for routine diagnosis due to its expensive outlay, high cost of reagents, and the advanced training required for the process. few samples of patients may require genome sequencing from samples as genome monitoring of circulating types may assist policymakers and healthcare personnel in terms of decision-making as well as the introduction of measures to reduce or abrogate the chain of transmission.99,113,114 real-time polymerase chain reaction it has been reported that real-time pcr is the gold standard molecular method for lab-based diagnosis of mpox.35,97,98 the real-time pcr workflow for mpox detection involves several key steps: denaturation, annealing, extension, and fluorescence readout. initially, the double-stranded dna is denatured to separate the strands into single strands, which facilitates the binding of primers to their respective target regions. the forward and reverse primers are designed to bind to specific sites on the single-stranded dna. the reverse primer plays a critical role in this process by binding to the complementary strand, enabling the synthesis of the complementary strand during the extension phase. during annealing, both the forward and reverse primers bind to their target sequences on the dna. following this, dna polymerase synthesises the complementary strand in the extension phase. the fluorescence signal is then released, allowing for real-time detection of the target sequence. regarding other tests involved, this real-time pcr assay specifically measures the amplification of target dna sequences, such as those within the g2r, b7r, b6r, n3r, and tnf receptor genes in the mpox virus genome, as previously reported.113,115 additionally, multiplex real-time pcr assays can be used to detect and differentiate various infectious agents and different subclades of the mpox virus.113,114,115,116,117,118,119 loop-mediated isothermal amplification real-time pcr is a standard technique method for diagnosing mpox infection; however, its shortcomings comprise sample processing time, constant availability of electricity supply, and technical skills.113,120 consequently, in terms of point of care, a user-friendly, simple, inexpensive, and rapid method for the laboratory diagnosis of mpox in low- to middle-income countries or areas with simple laboratory infrastructure are warranted. loop-mediated isothermal amplification is a recommended technique for the amplification of nucleic acid at a single and isothermal temperature of about 60 °c – 65 °c. while lamp requires less equipment than real-time pcr, it still relies on electricity, which may limit its utility in areas with inconsistent power supply. nevertheless, its simplicity and low-cost nature make it a valuable option for resource-limited settings.121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128 recombinase-based isothermal amplification assays recombinase-based isothermal amplification assays are also isothermal amplification methods involving enzyme-based dna amplification at a constant temperature of around 37 °c to 42 °c within 10 min,127 and, because of its simplicity, high sensitivity, and rapidity, this method is suitable for point-of-care or field applicability for mpox detection. sensors sensors are also used in laboratory diagnosis based on their ability to respond to stimuli, biological, physical, and chemical agents that elicit observable effects that are measurable through electrochemistry, colourimetry, and fluorescence. their applications are simple, rapid, inexpensive, and adaptable for use in rural or less-resourced settings.129 in terms of the method, the rna sensors or toehold switches can stimulate the translation of a reporter gene, such as beta-galactosidase or a green fluorescent protein, against a receptor rna trigger sequence present in the sample. this results in the activation of a reporter protein, followed by a light reflection that generates an observable colour change. alternatively, fluorescence-based methods may use fluorescent dyes such as 6-carboxyfluorescein or sybr green to detect the presence of the target rna, generating a measurable fluorescence signal.129,130,131 prevention and control for effective control of mpox outbreaks, rapid recognition and investigation of new cases, along with a comprehensive understanding of all possible routes and modes of transmission, are essential strategies for vaccine distribution.7 prevention of transmission of the mpox virus principally depends on hygienic practices and restrictions on contact with wild animals as the primary transmission mode of the virus to humans.1,84 direct contact with an infected animal should be prevented to avoid the animal-to-human route. additionally, physical contact with other people who are infected should be avoided, personal protective equipment should be used to reduce transmission, and there should be isolation of patients with mild cases of the disease.9 in cases where a person presents with lesions caused by mpox around the genitals, sexual contact must be avoided, or condoms should be used to avoid transmission.13 although the majority of mpox cases during the 2022 outbreak occurred in men who have sex with men, the infection can affect individuals of all genders and age groups. during pregnancy, special precautions are necessary to prevent vertical transmission from mother to child through the placenta. additionally, perinatal transmission can be avoided by preventing neonatal contact with mpox-related genital lesions during childbirth.131,132,133,134 other avenues of transmission include tourism and travelling.132 hence, prevention and control of the mpox virus can also be affected by controlling international air travel volume and entrenching policies regarding entry into countries. deng et al.40 showed that a reduction in the volume of air travel and strict policies on border entry contributed to a reduction of mpox introductions of infected persons into china.13 smallpox vaccine has been shown to provide almost 85% protection against mpox because of herd immunity.11 pre- and post-prophylaxis vaccination has also been recommended by the healthcare authorities for healthcare workers, laboratory workers and technicians, response teams against outbreaks, as well as scientists who research clinical samples, and vaccinators.84 post-exposure prophylaxis is suggested when there has been unprotected contact with infected people or there has been sharing of close spaces with infected people for extended periods where there might be secretions of aerosols and the presence of the virus in the air particles.84 vaccines, antiviral agents, and drugs such as tecovirimat are used as the first line of treatment. challenges and future perspectives mpox prevention, treatment, and control face several challenges, including healthcare gaps and the limited availability of treatments, vaccinations, and resource environments.135,136 diagnostic challenges, such as access to advanced technologies, can hinder timely and accurate diagnosis.137 additionally, fever-like illnesses accompanied by a rash may be misdiagnosed as mpox.49 to effectively control mpox, strong public health systems are required to monitor and manage outbreaks, and trace contacts. however, underdeveloped systems in endemic areas make containment difficult.138 public mistrust of vaccines, especially in poorly literate areas, can impede mass vaccination campaigns. immunisation resistance, motivated by misleading information, remains a significant barrier.139 recommendations the following recommendations are of significance in the narratives concerning mpox: • global emergency preparedness to tackle the potential pandemic of the disease is critical and should be actioned. • training and re-training of healthcare professionals on the differential diagnosis and other intricate aspects of the disease. • enhanced research activities to uncover emerging clades and their genomes, more insights into their epidemiology, and genomic surveillance to identify changes and adjust vaccines should be prioritised. • increased provision of vaccines, especially to endemic areas to curb centrifugal spread, should be central to the strategies to tackle the disease. • increased allocation of resources by countries in a bid to contain the menace of the disease and its anticipated health burden. • development of simple screening and diagnostic test kits or methods especially for use in less-resourced countries. conclusion mpox is not a new disease, but an emerging and re-emerging disease caused, probably, by increased rates of zoonoses, deforestation, food insecurity, global mobility, and increased socialisation pressures. others include risky behaviours and decreased immunity to the smallpox virus, which shares cross-reactive antigenic determinants with the mpox virus, resulting in waning protection offered by herd immunity against mpox. the key drivers of infections across various age groups and countries over the past years were the various clades. the historical foci of the disease have been mainly in africa, in addition to reported cases in other continents, indicating varying degrees of morbidity and mortality in all affected countries. management of the disease may depend on the range of clinical manifestations, including the use of antivirals, and antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections. preventive and control measures are predicated on the isolation of patients, protective sexual intercourse, avoiding contact with fluids of infected persons, and vaccination, among others. laboratory diagnosis involves the use of pcr for routine purposes, but the use of serological tests should be interpreted with caution because of shared antigenicity among the orthopoxvirues. electron microscopy and genome sequencing are mainly for research-related endeavours.
from outbreaks to artificial intelligence: a comprehensive review of monkeypox virus epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, vaccination, and deep learning applications abstract objectives: after the global impact of the covid-19 pandemic, concerns over virus transmission have risen. a state of health emergency was declared in 2022 due to clade 2 of the monkeypox virus. in august 2024, another emergency was declared by the world health organization because of the widespread clade 1b, which caused a more severe and lethal disease. this review synthesizes current mpox knowledge to assist policymakers, clinicians, and researchers in developing effective diagnostics, therapeutic interventions, vaccination strategies, and outbreak management. methods: this systematic review study searched for articles on virus epidemiology, virology, clinical features, transmission routes, available drugs and vaccines, and new artificial intelligence applications in diagnosis and drug discovery. results: mpox virus is a 200–250-nm, double-stranded dna virus that causes smallpox-like skin lesions. tecovirimat is the primary drug for severe cases, especially in people with suppressed immune systems. smallpox vaccines can help prevent mpox infection because of the genetic similarities between the mpox and smallpox viruses. ai-based models can assist medical teams in promptly diagnosing mpox skin lesions, improving decision-making for treatment. conclusion: this review highlights the importance of using traditional public health knowledge alongside modern ai to manage mpox outbreaks effectively. it shows that we need strong public health policies, focused interventions, and ongoing research on how ai can help control infectious diseases. 1. introduction monkeypox is a severe and potentially life-threatening zoonotic infectious disease found in central and west africa, but it is usually self-limiting. this tropical viral infectious disease is caused by the family poxviridae, the subfamily chordopoxvirinae, and the genus orthopoxvirus. these are among the largest known dna viruses, in both size and genetic complexity. its endemic prevalence in tropical regions, such as africa, and the characteristics of the pathogen that causes it highlight the tropical and infectious nature of this disease. it has two distinct strains: clade 1, the central african strain, which causes a more severe disease with a higher fatality rate, and clade 2, or the west african strain, which tends to result in a milder illness. after an incubation period of 1–3 weeks, nonspecific symptoms such as fever, headache, lymphadenopathy, and muscle pain appear, followed by rashes. in the 2022 outbreak, skin lesions were mainly reported in the anogenital region. it spreads through contact with infected animals, bodily fluids, or contaminated objects. pregnant women, children, those with an eczema history, and immunocompromised individuals are at higher risk. mpox is diagnosed through polymerase chain reaction testing of skin or mucous-membrane samples. treatment for mpox mainly involves supportive care. antiviral drugs such as tecovirimat, cidofovir, and brincidofovir are utilized under specific conditions. developing new drug delivery systems, such as tecovirimat adsorbed onto carbon microtubes, shows promise for more effective treatment. preventive measures are crucial, including avoiding direct contact with infected persons and adhering to strict hygiene and quarantine protocols. smallpox vaccines provide cross-protection against mpox due to genetic similarities, while mrna-based vaccines are being developed for targeted prevention. from january to august 2024, over 15,600 mpox cases and 537 deaths were reported globally, representing a significant public health challenge. the world health organization attributed this outbreak to the highly virulent clade 1b strain, associated with severe clinical manifestations and elevated mortality rates. the outbreak primarily affected east, central, west, and southern africa, with high cases reported in burundi, kenya, rwanda, uganda, the central african republic, ivory coast, and south africa. the rapid spread within these regions highlighted the need for coordinated containment strategies and improved healthcare infrastructure to manage such outbreaks. in august 2024, sweden reported the first case of clade 1b outside africa. the case involved an individual who had recently traveled to an affected african region, underscoring the significant role of international travel in the global spread of infectious diseases. this development emphasized the need for policymakers to strengthen border health protocols, implement targeted surveillance measures, and enhance global collaboration to prevent cross-border transmission. the 2024 outbreak has reinforced the importance of integrating travel-related health policies with outbreak management strategies to mitigate the risks of highly transmissible pathogens. this review brings together the latest knowledge about mpox, covering key areas such as its epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic methods, treatment options, vaccination strategies, and the emerging role of artificial intelligence in disease management. by combining traditional public health approaches with cutting-edge ai innovations, this review provides valuable insights for policymakers, clinicians, and researchers. it aims to support decision-making, identify research gaps, and enhance preparedness for managing mpox and similar infectious diseases. this comprehensive perspective contributes to global efforts to control outbreaks and strengthen public health responses. 2. method and material between march and august 2024, we conducted a comprehensive literature search employing advanced search techniques on pubmed, scopus, and google scholar to identify appropriate studies on mpox. our priority was on articles published from 2022 onward, while earlier publications were included selectively to provide historical context and foundational information. the search strategy utilized combinations of keywords such as “monkeypox epidemiology,” “clinical features of monkeypox,” “pcr monkeypox,” “monkeypox treatment options,” “monkeypox vaccines,” and “artificial intelligence in infectious diseases.” boolean operators were employed to refine results, for instance, “monkeypox and ” and “ai and monkeypox and diagnosis.” we defined strict inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure the quality and relevance of the studies. peer-reviewed articles, case reports, case series, and studies involving human subjects were included, particularly those addressing epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, vaccination, and ai applications. non–peer-reviewed articles, studies focusing exclusively on animal models, articles with insufficient data, and meta-analyses were excluded. we adopted a double-masked screening process to minimize selection bias. two independent reviewers assessed article titles and abstracts. discrepancies were resolved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer. full-text articles were evaluated using a predefined checklist to ensure methodological rigor and relevance. to further reduce bias, a fourth team member reviewed the final selection and data extraction for accuracy. utilizing multiple databases also ensured the comprehensive coverage of the available literature. data extraction followed a systematic approach, capturing key details such as study design, geographical location, sample characteristics, clinical findings, and significant outcomes. a standardized extraction form was used to maintain uniformity across studies. the findings were synthesized qualitatively to provide a thorough overview of mpox's epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic methods, treatment strategies, and ai applications. the flowchart clearly outlines the thorough and methodical process we use for selecting articles, ensuring quality and relevance. 3. results 3.1. history and epidemiology in 1958, the virus was named mpox after a new orthopoxvirus outbreak among cynomolgus monkeys in copenhagen. the first case of human infection with the mpox in the democratic republic of the congo was observed in 1970 in a 9-month-old boy. in the 1970s, mpox outbreaks in the drc spread through human-to-human transmission and close contact with infected animals during the hunts in warm seasons and hunting areas. the increase in human-to-human transmission raises apprehensions about the potential for widespread zoonotic disease. as a result, between 1981 and 1986, the who reported 338 suspected cases of the disease and 33 deaths through the implementation of surveillance programs. subsequently, positive cases decreased dramatically over the following six years, with only 13 cases registered in cameroon, gabon, and the drc from 1986 to 1992. kasaï-oriental province in the drc was the site of the next major outbreak two years following 1992, with 511 suspected cases in the katako-kumba region and 24 in the lodja health zone. between 1998 and 2001, the drc and car experienced an ongoing mpox outbreak, during which the ministry of health of drc documented 1265 cases over the three years. in 2003, the united states reported the first human cases of mpox outside africa, with 72 instances of clade 2 mpox, with a median age of 28 years traced back to prairie dogs that had been infected by rodents transported from ghana to texas. from september to december 2005, cases spread in sudan's unity state, with 760 cases reported across nine locations in congo by 2007. no outbreaks occurred outside africa until 2021. in africa, outbreaks were reported in the drc, sierra leone, and car between 2010 and 2016. these included a small outbreak in the likouala region of the drc, an outbreak in bo city, sierra leone, and reported cases in bangassou, in car. a more widespread outbreak occurred in the drc between 2014 and 2016, with 587 suspected cases detected during the country's surveillance program. the largest outbreak of mpox in west africa occurred between 2017 and 2018, with 244 cases following the infection of an 11-year-old child in nigeria. the travel of suspected cases of clade 2 from nigeria to the united kingdom and israel caused the 2018 outbreak in these two countries. in july 2021, a middle-aged american man with a history of traveling to nigeria was reported as an infection-positive case in the united states. as vaccination against smallpox declined, global immunity to orthopoxviruses also decreased. in march 2022, while the world was still grappling with covid-19, six confirmed cases of mpox and two deaths were reported in the car. from the beginning of 2022 until april 17, the drc registered 1152 suspected cases with 55 deaths. in 2022, a major global outbreak of mpox occurred as the infection spread from africa to europe and america. the majority of cases were among men who have sex with men, many of whom had not traveled to areas where the disease is endemic. it is vital to clarify the epidemiological links between instances in different regions and the role of asymptomatic in spreading the virus. comparatively to 2022, the practically steady and declining trend of obtaining this virus in africa in 2023 is seen. between the start of 2024 and the writing of this article in august, there have been more than 15,600 positive cases with 537 deaths. unlike the 2022 outbreak with clade 2, the who has linked this new outbreak in the drc to the more lethal strain of the virus, clade 1b, to neighboring nations. the new outbreak began in july of this year and is currently affecting east, central, west, and south africa. the nations that reported positive cases of the new disease in the most recent outbreak were burundi, kenya, rwanda, and uganda in east africa; the car in central africa; ivory coast in west africa; and south africa. on august 14, 2024, the who again issued a public health emergency due to the general spread of the most current strain. the clade has quickly spread to countries outside africa, marking a significant global impact. on august 15, 2024, sweden became the first nation outside of africa to record a positive case of the hazardous clade of mpox in someone who had recently resided in africa. pakistan and the philippines also announced new positive cases of the clade 1b following sweden's case. 3.2. virology the mpox virus is a double-stranded dna virus belonging to the poxviridae family and genus orthopoxviruses. its vast persistence in the zoonotic cycle and diverse range of hosts set it apart from other members of this family. it was known by this name since 1958 after infecting cynomolgus monkeys. there are now two different clades of the mpox virus. clade 1 is the leading cause of mpox infections in central africa and the congo basin, with a case-fatality rate ranging from 1% to 12%. conversely, the most common strain in west africa is clade 2, which has a much lower case-fatality rate of about 0.1%. the 2022 global outbreak of mpox was similarly linked to clade 2, which exhibited distinct severity and clinical manifestations when compared to clade 1. the differences in case-fatality rates and infection severity between these two clades are caused by a slight genetic variance of around 0.5% in their genomic sequences. host–response modifier genes, such as the complement pathway inhibitor enzyme gene, exhibit diversity among the clades of the mpox virus, contributing to the differences between them. as suggested by animal studies, the absence of this gene in clade 2 is responsible for the lower case-fatality rate observed in this clade. the b.1 lineage, a subgroup of clade 2b, was responsible for the 2022 global outbreak, and the only reported case of mpox in iran was infected with this lineage. the mpox genome is a 197-kilobase pair ds-dna linear genome with inverted terminal repeats at both ends. it encodes approximately 200 proteins essential for viral particle formation, dna replication, and completing the viral structure within the host cell. the mpox virus has a brick-shaped structure measuring 200–250 nm. its surface is covered in tubular filaments, and a biconcave core houses the viral genome, similar to those of variola and vaccinia viruses. 3.3. diagnose diagnosing mpox without clinical testing is especially important in low-resource settings where access to healthcare facilities and laboratory tests is limited. recognizing key symptoms, such as fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, swollen lymph nodes, and a distinctive rash that progresses through various stages, can help identify the disease early. this approach can reduce the financial burden on families and ensure timely care. social and environmental factors play a major role in the spread of mpox. in regions where the disease is common, such as parts of africa, people often live in close contact with wildlife, increasing the risk of catching the virus. activities like hunting and eating bushmeat expose individuals to infected animals, such as rodents and primates, which are the primary carriers of the virus. communities living near forests or rural areas where these animals are common face a higher risk of infection. poor living conditions, such as lack of clean water, overcrowded homes, and limited access to healthcare, make it easier for the disease to spread within families and neighborhoods. migration, travel, and large gatherings also contribute to the virus moving into new areas. raising awareness about these risks, encouraging preventive actions, and training healthcare workers to identify symptoms can make a big difference in controlling mpox outbreaks and protecting vulnerable communities. 3.3.1. laboratory diagnosis as advised by the who, other potential diagnoses such as syphilis, orf, mycosis, and drug sensitivity reactions should also be considered in the diagnosis of mpox infection. real-time pcr is the most crucial test for virus detection, with laboratory guidelines recommending the targeting of at least two common genes among different strains of the disease. this adaptability is evident in the targeting of genes such as the tnf receptor gene, e9l dna polymerase gene, b6r envelope protein gene, and dna-dependent rna polymerase gene, along with proposed target proteins including polymerase subunit 18, b7r, fl3, n3r, c3l complement-binding protein, cp protein gene, and o2l gene. other less common identification methods include electron microscopy following staining to identify the virus in lesion samples and detecting specific viral antigens through immunohistochemistrical methods. because the virus proliferates in mammalian cell lines, including hela, vero, bsc-1, and rk-13, virus culture using these cell lines is one of the more established diagnostic methods. diagnosing mpox with specific serological tests is challenging due to potential cross-reactivity with other orthopoxviruses. assessing igm in the first week or igg in paired samples 21 days apart can significantly impact patient care and aid in diagnosis. 3.4. incubation period according to reports from the 2022 mpox outbreak, the illness typically takes 5 to 13 days to incubate. however, the length of time has varied depending on the region. the incubation period ranged from 6.5 to 10.9 days among patients tested in italy in may and june of 2022. compared to the 2005 outbreak in the united states, which lasted between 11 and 18 days, it seems that the incubation time for mpox infections in 2022 has changed. furthermore, several factors affect the incubation period, like the infection route. for instance, compared to infection through sexual contact, the incubation time is shortened by being bitten or scratched. additionally, some reports indicate that this period can extend to 21 days. 3.5. pathogenesis the method of virus entry and the specific clade of mpox can affect the clinical manifestation of infection. the virus begins reproducing after it invades the host's respiratory system and mucous membranes in the throat and mouth through the respiratory route. likewise, after exposure to mpox in the dermis, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells can undergo this process. immunohistochemistry of skin lesion biopsies can reveal intraepidermal, intrafollicular, intravascular, interstitial, and perivascular neutrophils, t-cell infiltrates, cytotoxic t cells, and macrophages. the pathophysiology of mpox infection drafts two viremias. during primary viremia, the virus replicates at the site of infection and spreads to the lymph nodes, leading to submandibular, cervical, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. after secondary viremia, the virus disseminates to organs through the bloodstream. the virus variant significantly affects disease manifestation. in clade 1 of mpox, the virus replicates in the respiratory epithelium during the incubation period before spreading to lymphoid organs such as the spleen and liver and then can be detected in the blood after the incubation period. but primate models, infected by clade 2, exhibited that the replication of virus befalls in just cutaneous and lymphoid system. this is why the clade of mpox has higher pathogenicity. the replication cycle of the mpox virus begins with the virus entering the host cell via micropinocytosis or direct fusion with the plasma membrane. crucial for the attachment of the virion are key components such as exterior virion proteins, surface glycosaminoglycans, and extracellular matrix elements. upon entry, the virus damages its outer membrane, releasing its core into the cytoplasm for uncoating. early gene expression generates essential early proteins, such as intermediate transcription factors, dna polymerase, and rna polymerase, required for viral replication and immune response control. the virus's dna replicates within specialized areas of the cytoplasm, producing multiple copies of the viral genome. the virus synthesizes the intermediate proteins and late transcription factors to produce immature virions and then mature to become mature virions. the golgi apparatus transports some mvs, envelops them, and transforms them into wrapped virions. wv is carried to the cell's outside edge, either discharged as extracellular virions or remained as cell-associated enveloped virions for cell transmission. cell lysis can also release mvs, facilitating their transfer from one host to another. this process facilitates effective duplication and dissemination, resulting in observable clinical manifestations such as skin rash and swelling of the lymph nodes. figure 2 illustrates this process in detail, providing a more precise understanding. 3.6. immune response the immune response to human mpox infection involves both innate and adaptive immunity. the innate immune system is triggered in response to viral infections. this activation occurs mainly through the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1, and interferons by dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages. these cytokines serve to signal and attract more immune cells to the site of infection. this coordinated immune response aims to contain and eliminate the pathogen, ensuring a thorough and efficient defense. both cd4+ and cd8+ cytotoxic t cells are activated by mhc class i antigens from macrophages and dendritic cells. cd4 t cells help b cells become plasma cells that secrete antibodies. cd8+ t cells activated by interleukins, granzyme b, and perforin become more cytotoxic. this synchronized response kills virus-infected cells and provides a strong resistance against viral infections. toll-like receptors, nod-like receptors, c-type lectin receptors, and rig-1-like receptors are pattern recognition receptors that play a crucial role in the innate immune system. they are responsible for identifying a wide range of molecules associated with damaged cells. upon the activation of prps, a series of processes are initiated, resulting in the activation of transcription factors associated with inflammation, such as nuclear factor-kappa b and inf regulatory factors. on the other hand, the virus has effective ways to dodge the immune system. a47r is a protein produced by mpox that can interact with intracellular adaptors of tlrs and suppress the upregulation of nf-κb expression, which leads to the inhibition of apoptosis regulating via interaction with the iκb kinase complex that is necessary for the activation of nf-κb and has a critical role in control of programmed cell death. mpox employs soluble cytokines to evade the immune system. these cytokines competitively bind to the immune system's cytokines, hindering the expression of antiviral genes and facilitating viral replication. this is achieved by disrupting the activated downstream signaling pathway when cytokine receptors are occupied. additionally, mpox downregulates the expression of mhc-1 on infected cells and secretes proteins that can target immune molecules such as il-1β, il8, ccl5, and ccl2. while both clade 1 and clade 2 of mpox can produce proteins that mimic bcl-2 proteins, which play a crucial role in regulating apoptosis, the zaire-i-96 strain of mpox can encode a protein called p1l that can modulate the apoptosis pathway similar to bcl-2. 3.7. transmission mostly by animal-to-human transmission, direct human-to-human transmission through close contact, and indirect human-to-human transmission. 3.7.1. animal-to-human transmission until the outbreak of mpox in 2022, most of the studies were on direct or indirect transmission from infected animals to humans. besides infecting via direct contact with infected animals, the transmission of the infection through respiratory fluids, fomites, and consumption of infected meats is prominent in the disease. while it is not definitively established that rodents are the main reservoir of mpox infection, humans are regarded as incidental hosts in the natural environment. in 1964, american giant anteaters at the rotterdam zoo were infected, most likely due to contact with monkeys. in a 1980 study of 338 mpox patients, over 72% of cases in the drc were linked to animal interactions. in 2003, unexpected events occurred when exotic rats from ghana, sold as pets, entered the american pet trade. the virus then spread to prairie dogs, leading to human outbreaks as people came in contact with sick animals and their fluids. this transmission occurred primarily through respiratory droplets and saliva. in several african countries, lifestyles include forest living, hunting, bushmeat handling, and even animal's cage cleaning and infected animal biting, which greatly increase the likelihood of animal-to-human transmission of mpox. these activities increase human–wildlife interaction, therefore increasing exposure to possible animal reservoirs and vectors and helping infectious diseases to spread. 3.7.2. human-to-human transmission unlike animal-to-human infection, human-to-human has a low transmission rate. all 57 healthcare professionals who came into unprotected contact with mpox in a 2005 cohort study stayed asymptomatic over the observation period. aside from the possibility of infection spreading through contact with contaminated objects or using the same serving dish as an infected person, direct exposure to respiratory droplets, extended face-to-face interaction, physical contact with affected skin areas, and sexual contact are significant routs of transmitting mpox between humans. in the 2022 outbreak, the primary mode of human-to-human transmission appears to be through sexual contact. a study in portugal included 47 male participants, 39 of whom were recognized as msm. likewise, six individuals reported engaging in sexual activity with more than ten. in another 2022 observational cohort study that carried out in bichat–claude bernard university hospital in paris on 264 patients, 245/295 of them were men engaged in sexual activities with other men. 3.8. clinical manifestations after an asymptomatic latent period of approximately 8 days, individuals infected with mpox exhibit nonspecific prodromal symptoms. these early signs, which precede the characteristic skin lesions, include fever, pruritus, and swollen painful lymph nodes in the submandibular, cervical, and inguinal regions—crucial for differentiating mpox from smallpox or chickenpox. typical symptoms within a 95% ci are fatigue, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, headache, backache, cough, photophobia, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. skin lesions, usually 5–10 mm in size, start on the trunk and face and spread centrifugally to peripheral organs such as the palms and soles about 1–3 days after the prodromal phase. they progress from macular rashes to maculopapular, vesicular, and pustular stages and form crusts and scabs within one to two weeks. lymphadenopathy remains due to the virus's strong immune response. a thorough assessment examining cases before and after the 2022 outbreak found that more than 100 lesions were observed in almost 50% of the patients. simultaneously with the emergence of skin lesions, lesions also arise in the oral and vaginal regions. it is advised to practice isolation during the initial week of the rash, as the patient is considered contagious until the scabs separate and the throat swab pcr findings show no signs of infection. immunocompromised and pregnant individuals are more prone to experiencing complications of the condition. these complications include secondary bacterial soft tissue infection, hemorrhagic pustules, pneumonia, and encephalitis. mpox can be passed from mother to fetus during delivery in pregnant women, potentially resulting in spontaneous miscarriage occurring 14–24 days after the onset of fever. a stillborn fetus may display maculopapular lesions, hepatomegaly, and hydrops fetalis. postnatal transmission can also happen through close contact while breastfeeding, comparable to the transmission of varicella zoster and herpes simplex viruses. however, the clinical manifestations differed slightly during the 2022 outbreak. several cases exhibited a solitary cutaneous lesion, predominantly localized in the anogenital region, and frequently initiated its development in that area. the lesions were frequently characterized by discomfort and did not exhibit the previously reported tendency to spread to other locations. more research is needed to understand the increased sexual transmission of clade 2 of the virus and its genetic characteristics. furthermore, in certain instances, cutaneous lesions manifested prior to the commencement of fever. nevertheless, a significant majority of participants in a cohort study conducted in spain experienced systemic symptoms before the appearance of a rash. as summarized in table 1, fever was reported in 53%–72% of patients across different studies, with lymph node swelling being a notable feature in 29%–85% of cases, distinguishing mpox from other orthopoxvirus infections. skin lesions displayed a significant regional variation. genital lesions were the most common, affecting up to 75% of patients in spain, portugal, and canada, as noted by tarin-vicente et al. and sousa et al.. in the united kingdom and germany, facial and trunk lesions were more prevalent, with rates between 20% and 55%. these differences highlight the need for tailored diagnostic approaches. table 1 shows that affected individuals typically have a median age of 35–42 years, with a notable prevalence among msm in urban areas. additionally, hiv coinfection rates ranged from 21% to 47%, indicating a need for integrated care for high-risk populations 3.9. complications mpox infections can lead to both neurological and psychosocial consequences. according to a nigerian study conducted in 2020, 25% of patients who were admitted to the hospital exhibited psychiatric symptoms, including anxiety, despair, low mood, and suicidal thoughts. distinguishing these psychological symptoms from those caused by hospitalization and quarantine presents a considerable challenge. neurological issues such as seizures, disorientation, and encephalitis have been seen in individuals with mpox during the 2022 outbreak, with prevalence rates of 2.7%, 2.4%, and 2, respectively. moreover, brain magnetic resonance imaging scans of patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis who have received vaccinations reveal normal levels of viruses and detectable specific mpox igm antibodies in the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid. during the 2022 outbreak in the united states, two individuals with weakened immune systems developed encephalomyelitis 5–9 days after experiencing initial symptoms. in the cases of systemic mpox infection, the lack of viral nucleic acid in the csf, elevated csf protein levels, and pleocytosis indicate autoimmune responses rather than viral invasion. mri scans showed brain and spinal lesions in patients 1 and 2, which suggests mpox-related proctitis in patient 2. mpox virus causes ocular symptoms in unvaccinated and immunosuppressed people. eye rashes, conjunctivitis, redness, discomfort, and discharge, conjunctival ulceration, lesions, and eyelid pustules and pseudopustules are given by pooled prevalence. severe infections can lead to complications such as myocarditis, epiglottitis, peritonsillar abscess, rectal wall rupture, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, bronchopneumonia, and necrotizing pneumonia. the immune response to viral fragments impacting the myocardium can cause myocarditis or pericarditis. this phenomenon can also be observed following the administration of the smallpox vaccine. a review study conducted in 2023 on myocarditis caused by mpox infection found that all cases of myocarditis were accompanied by chest pain and difficulty breathing. electrocardiographic tests showed st-elevation in 44% of patients and sinus tachycardia in 22% of patients. echocardiographic findings indicated a decrease in the ejection fraction in 43% of patients, with an average ejection fraction of 52.14%. cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed gadolinium enhancement and edema in 40% of the cases examined. there have been reports of bronchopneumonia and necrotizing pneumonia in humans infected with mpox. one case involved a 36-year-old man who had hiv, tertiary syphilis, cryptosporidiosis, and kaposi's sarcoma. chest radiography showed progressive bilateral nodules, and he developed necrotizing pneumonia as a result of the mpox infection. unfortunately, he died from pseudomonas sepsis on the 28th day of the infection. the icu admission of a 34-year-old caucasian french woman revealed the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, characterized by symptoms such as fever, hypotension, decreased oxygen saturation, and mental abnormalities. the pcr test confirmed that she was infected with mpox, and the culture of her pleural fluid showed the presence of streptococcus pyogenes. the high-resolution computed tomography scans showed significant bilateral consolidation in this case. 3.10. treatment given the self-limiting nature of mpox in most cases, conventional antiviral treatment is often unnecessary since many patients can recover with supportive care alone. to reduce the risk of drug resistance and ensure the effectiveness of antiviral drugs, it is essential to limit their use to severe cases or patients at high risk of serious consequences and death, such as those with weakened immune systems due to hiv or chemotherapy with alkylating drugs. supportive care management: behavior, local, and systemic treatments are used to cure mpox. avoid contact lenses, use trifluridine or mineral oils on the eyes for pain and lubrication, apply lidocaine gel to moderate skin lesions, and use a cream with amitriptyline 2%, ketamine 5%, and baclofen 5% for painful anogenital lesions. nsaids are also given systemically to ease pain. it is advised to cover mpox cutaneous lesions to stop the disease from spreading directly through them and to gently wash them with soap and water in order to treat mpox dermal lesions optimally. patients should also avoid scratching lesions to prevent infection and spread. antiviral treatment: the lack of specific antiviral mpox drugs necessitates using tecovirimat and cdv, which were initially approved for other uses. understanding the virus's structure and critical proteins is crucial for developing targeted antiviral therapies. tecovirimat, also known as tpoxx®, is an antiviral medication specifically developed to inhibit the vp37 protein, which is produced by the f13l gene. this gene is responsible for conferring resistance to bcv in orthopoxviruses, including vaccinia and mpox. this protein is crucial for creating extracellular enveloped virions by assisting in encasing intracellular mvs with the lipid membrane of the host cell. tecovirimat inhibits the development of mvs that can leave the cell and disseminate the virus by binding to vp37 and blocking its interactions with gtpase, rab9, and tip47, thus restricting the infection. this antiviral medication was authorized by the fda in 2018. it is offered in two dosage forms: a 600-mg oral capsule taken twice a day and a 200-mg intravenous infusion also taken twice a day. this treatment is the principal treatment for severe instances of mpox and individuals at high risk of severe disease, such as those with a weakened immune system and asplenia, or who are receiving alkylating drugs. significantly, the oral formulation demonstrates increased absorption when consumed with food in a fed condition. however, the efficacy of this drug can be compromised by resistance due to a mutation at amino acid position 277. in a 2023 report, 84.6% of patients receiving tecovirimat intravenously experienced at least one adverse effect. the most common were pain at the infusion site, swelling, and erythema. headaches and dizziness were also reported by 26.9% and 23% of patients, respectively. other side effects such as myalgia, back pain, diarrhea, and photophobia were rare, occurring in less than 5% of cases. no renal dose adjustment needed in the capsule formulation of tecovirimat, while its iv formulation is contraindicated in crcl below 30 ml/min due to b-cyclodextrin existence in formulation. prairie dogs, macaque monkeys, and cynomolgus monkeys are the examples of tecovirimat's therapeutic applications. in a 2011 study, prairie dogs infected with the congo basin clade were administered intranasally with tecovirimat, and it was celebrated that 100% of cases improved and became asymptomatic without any instances of death. before that, in a 2009 study, intravenous administration of tecovirimat at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day, three days postinfection, established a zero percent mortality rate in cynomolgus monkeys infected with the west african clade. it is also worth mentioning that there are no reports of fetal toxicity regarding this medicine. cdv, also known by its iupac designation oxymethylphosphonic acid, is a pharmaceutical compound that acts as a cytosine nucleotide analog and inhibits the activity of dna polymerase. it has been granted approval by the fda for the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis in individuals who are infected with hiv. upon cellular uptake, cdv undergoes phosphorylation by the host cell's enzyme, resulting in the formation of cdv diphosphate, which is its active form. this active form affects the elongation of the dna chain during replication by competitively limiting the inclusion of deoxycytidine triphosphate. due to inadequate absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, pharmacists were compelled to produce an intravenous dosage form with a recommended dose of 5 mg/kg once weekly for the treatment of mpox infection. the most significant adverse effect of cdv is nephrotoxicity, which is dose-dependent. this is characterized by the presence of proteinuria followed by glucosuria, an increase in the blood creatinine level, and a decrease in the serum bicarbonate concentration. additional documented adverse effects comprise neutropenia, ocular hypotony, iritis, uveitis, and pyrexia. misuse of different antimicrobial medications may lead to the development of drug-resistant strains in the same group of microorganisms. the susceptibility of the mpox virus to resistance is a significant trouble. the emergence of cdv-resistant species among orthopoxviruses, including mpox, complicates the situation further. the rise of cdv-resistant orthopoxviruses, such as smallpox, vaccinia, and mpox, presents a major health risk due to specific mutations found in the e9l and f13l genes of vaccinia virus. similar genetic variations, specifically a314v and a684t, have also been observed in mpox virus. these genetic changes result in reduced ability to cause disease and replicate efficiently, requiring ongoing monitoring of the genome, the creation of different treatment options, and additional investigation into the specific molecular processes and adaptability of resistant strains. in 2021, the fda-approved bcv for treating smallpox. this medication enhances the lipophilicity and cellular permeability of cdv by including a hexadecyloxypropyl group. this anti-dsdna virus drug hydrolyzes to cdv after entering into host's cells and is then phosphorylated to cvd-pp to the inhibition of dna replication. the coadministration of tecovirimat with bcv can reduce the effective concentration of the latter. bcv has a long half-life similar to cdv but with reduced nephrotoxicity due to its lipophilicity. additionally, bcv has significant concentrations in the lungs, spleen, and liver. bcv has the potential to raise liver enzyme levels, particularly alanine aminotransferase, and raise bilirubin levels, which can cause damage to liver cells. the fasting state reduces bcv's orally absorption and plasma concentration. bcv is not a recommended drug for pregnant or breastfeeding women. table 2 compares therapeutic agents for mpox, including their mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, and safety profiles. tecovirimat is versatile and safe for various populations, while bcv requires hepatic monitoring, and cdv demands renal precautions. this analysis aids clinicians in tailoring treatments based on patient-specific needs and contraindications. immunoglobulin therapy involves the administration of antibodies to enhance the immune response against specific pathogens. the cdc recommends vaccinia immune globulin intravenous for the treatment of orthopoxviruses infections, and it has received fda approval in 2005 for managing complications associated with vaccinia vaccination. derived from the plasma of healthy donors, this treatment involves aggregated polyclonal immunoglobulin and has shown cross-neutralization activity against the mpox virus in a macaca mulatta model infected with the cb clade of mpox, effectively inhibiting the virus from infecting additional cells, as depicted in figure 2. imatinib, a drug primarily used for chronic myeloid leukemia, has shown potential as an antiviral agent by disrupting actin dynamics and preventing viral egress. this could reduce the spread of the virus by inhibiting the release of eevs. other medications have shown effectiveness against mpox besides imatinib. in a 2017 experiment, resveratrol, found in plants such as grapes, peanuts, and blueberries, hindered virus reproduction by disrupting dna synthesis. ribavirin, a medication commonly used to treat hepatitis c, has also shown effectiveness against mpox and other orthopoxviruses infections. in infected cells treated with recombinant inf-beta, the antiviral protein myxovirus resistance protein a was induced, and it was exhibited that the continuous expression of mxa inhibits mpox infection. further investigations have been carried out to find out the antiviral properties of recombinant beta inf against the mpox virus. for numerous infectious diseases, including mpox infection, new medication formulations and techniques of administration are in development. a striking example comes from a 2024 study on a poly core-enclosed tpe-bt-dptq. we further refined the core, combined it, and extruded it under a macrophage membrane. we recovered the membrane by means of mechanical fragmentation, ultracentrifugation, and hypotonic lysis among other techniques. the result of this technique was the final biomimetic nanoparticles, sometimes referred to as tbd@m nps. in this work, photothermal bnps administered to mice infected with mpox produced a notable reduction in viral titers within the lesions, accelerated healing of the lesions, and effective inhibition of viral transmission. 3.11. vaccination because orthopoxviruses share genetic similarities, the immune response to one can help protect against others. smallpox vaccines can prevent mpox. there are three generations of vaccines against smallpox. the most significant of the first generation of these vaccines, which successfully prevented person-to-person transmission in africa, is dryvax®. the production of dryvax® was discontinued in the united states in 1978 after 15 million doses had been produced. other first-generation vaccines utilizing a live-unattenuated platform, which are no longer licensed, include lister-based vaccines and the new york city board of health. acam2000®, a second-generation vaccine developed by emergent biosolutions, is a live-attenuated, replication-com
