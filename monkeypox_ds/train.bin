Virology, epidemiology, transmissions, diagnostic tests, prophylaxis and treatments of human Mpox: Saudi Arabia perspective

Abstract

Mpox (Monkeypox) is a highly contagious viral disease that can be transmitted from animal-to-human or human-to-human through intimate contact, Mpox is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV), which is an enveloped double-stranded DNA that belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus, Poxviridae family, and subfamily Chordopoxvirinae. Mpox cases were previously only reported in West and Central Africa, however in recent times non-endemic countries including Saudi Arabia (SA) also reported confirmed Mpox cases. The first laboratory-confirmed human Mpox case in SA was reported on 14 July 2022, since then a number of confirmed Mpox cases have been reported by WHO in SA. These confirmed Mpox cases in SA were observed among individuals with a history of visiting European Union countries. SA is not only at risk of importation of Mpox cases owing to travel to such countries, but also there are various other risk factors including geographic proximity to the African continent, trade in exotic animals, and massive inflow of tourists. Therefore, government health authorities of SA should continue to collaborate with various international health organizations including WHO to prevent, manage or monitor potential health risks at most of the entry points in SA including highways, seaports, and airports by ensuring adherence to hygiene protocols, vaccinations, and health screenings. There are a range of diagnostic tests are currently available that can be used in SA to confirm Mpox infections, including real-time PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, serological testing, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR-Cas)-based systems, whole-genome sequencing, electron microscopy, and virus isolation and culture. There is no approved treatment specifically for Mpox, however multiple approved antiviral agents for smallpox treatment were found to be useful in Mpox treatment and in the management of Mpox outbreaks, such as- trifluridine, brincidofovir, tecovirimat, and cidofovir. The aim of this review is to provide valuable insights regarding virology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, transmissions, clinical presentation, diagnostic tests, prophylactic measures and therapeutic options of Mpox from SA perspective. Moreover, a side-by-side discussion on the global trend and scenarios of Mpox has been provided for comparison and further improvement in measures against Mpox in SA.

INTRODUCTION

Mpox (previously known as monkeypox) is a viral infectious disease caused by the Mpox virus (MPXV), which is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Poxviridae family of the genus Orthopoxvirus (Mohapatra et al., 2024). MPXV infects a range of animals including non-human primates, such as monkeys, dogs, squirrels, rodents, and others. In 1958, Mpox was first identified in monkeys reserved for research in an animal facility in Denmark (Parker and Buller, 2013). Humans are accidental hosts of MPXV and the first human Mpox case was documented in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 1970 (Mohapatra et al., 2024). Mpox cases were initially common in the African countries including DRC, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Gabon, Nigeria, and Cameroon (Suvvari et al., 2023). However, an increased number of human cases of Mpox was reported in all 5 continents in 2022. Both U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) have classified Mpox as an emerging disease because of its rapid dissemination and high infectivity (Islam et al., 2023). In addition, between July 2022 and May 2023, WHO declared Mpox as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (Kuehn et al., 2024). From 1 January 2022 to 11 October 2024, the WHO has already reported 106,310 laboratory-confirmed Mpox cases and 234 deaths in 123 countries (World Health Organization, 2024a).

Over the past four decades, multiple factors have contributed in the increased incidences of the Mpox outbreak. Smallpox immunization program discontinuance is one such factor. It has been demonstrated that the smallpox vaccine can provide up to around 85% effectiveness in preventing Mpox. Extensive intake of animal meat as a protein source particularly in the civil war and poverty-stricken regions, where the animal is a potential reservoir of MPXV. Other factors that are playing a role in increasing Mpox cases include elevated exposure to reservoir animals, environmental and ecological conditions (for example- clearance of tropical rainforests), the ease of transboundary travel, and the growing human population worldwide (Dhawan et al., 2022; Fahrni et al., 2022; Priyanka et al., 2023a, 2023b; Choudhary et al., 2024; Mohapatra et al., 2024). Interestingly, various meteorological factors also play a major role in Mpox cases, where temperature is found to be positively linked with Mpox cases and wind speed is negatively linked (Islam et al., 2022b, 2024). There is also a link between Mpox cases and obesity, where increased occurrence of Mpox has been observed in obese individuals (Hasan et al., 2023).

Mpox was previously only reported in West and Central Africa, however in recent times non-endemic countries also reported confirmed Mpox cases including the Saudi Arabia (SA) and its neighboring countries (Assiri et al., 2024). The first laboratory-confirmed human Mpox case in SA was reported on 14 July 2022 and a total of 8 confirmed Mpox cases were reported by WHO as of 30 June 2024 (Assiri et al., 2023; World Health Organization, 2024a). In SA, confirmed Mpox cases were observed among individuals with a history of visiting European Union countries. SA is not only at risk of importation of Mpox cases owing to travel to such countries, but also there are various other risk factors including geographic proximity to the African continent, trade in exotic animals, and massive inflow of tourists. Moreover, unlike earlier outbreaks, it has been observed that there is also a change in the nature of Mpox epidemiology and an increased number of older and middle-aged adults are being affected by this infectious disease (Bunge et al., 2022). Since WHO has declared Mpox as a health emergency, therefore the Ministry of Health (MOH) in SA has developed some guidelines and preventive measures to prevent the spread and transmission of MPXV including targeted use of the 2nd or 3rd-generation Mpox or smallpox vaccines, the use of typical polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, timely screening with nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT), and tracing and isolating Mpox affected individuals (Alshahrani et al., 2022b). This review aims to provide valuable insights regarding virology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, transmissions, clinical presentation, diagnostic tests, prophylactic measures and therapeutic options of Mpox from SA perspective. Moreover, a side-by-side discussion on the global trend and scenarios of Mpox have been provided for comparison and further improvement in measures against Mpox in SA.

VIROLOGY OF MPXV

CLASSIFICATION

MPXV is an enveloped double-stranded DNA that belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus, Poxviridae family, and subfamily Chordopoxvirinae. MPXV is closely related to cowpox virus, vaccinia virus (VACV), and variola virus (Bunge et al., 2022). Clade I or Congo Basin clade and Clade II or West African clade are the 2 distinct MPXV phylogenetic clades. There are 2 subclasses of Clade II including Clade IIa and Clade IIb. In general, the genomic sequences of Clade I and Clade II derived MPXV strains show an overall 99% identity of nucleotides within the same region, while 95% nucleic acid identity across different geographical clusters (Liang et al., 2022).

GENOMIC ORGANIZATION AND MORPHOLOGY OF MPXV

The genome of MPXV is around 197,000 kb and possesses over 190 open reading frames (ORFs), with inverted terminal repeats flanking the terminal ends (
Figure 1
). A minimum of 90 ORFs are essential for the poxvirus replication and morphogenesis. A number of non-essential ORFs are supposed to have a significant contribution in the alterations in poxvirus host tropism, pathogenesis, and immunomodulation, while the functions of most of the ORFs are yet to be characterized. The virions of MPXV have an average size of 280 nm × 220 nm and they are either oval or barrel-shaped. A unique dumbbell-shaped nucleoprotein core is present in poxvirus mature particles and they contain a large genome composed of double-stranded linear DNA. Moreover, MPXV virions possess virus-encoded DNA-dependent RNA polymerases and more than 30 viral structural and membrane proteins (Yu et al., 2023). Essential orthopoxvirus (OPV) genes are found in the central portion of the MPXV genome. Nonetheless, as compared to the genomes of other OPVs, a small number of ORFs are either truncated or lost in the genome of MPXV. Multiple disrupted ORFs encoding genes associated with immune evasion have been reported in Clade II, where these mutations might be responsible for the lesser virulence of Clade II in comparison with Clade I (Reynolds and Damon, 2012).

The extracellular enveloped virus (EEV) and intracellular mature virus (IMV) are the 2 different infectious MPXV forms. These infectious forms are also different in terms of cell-infecting mechanisms and surface glycoproteins. IMV is released during cell lysis, while EEV is accountable for early dispersal. The major structural difference between EEV and IMV is that the additional outermost membrane layer is not present in IMV. There is also a difference in the quantities of viral proteins incorporated into the 2 types of virions (Yu et al., 2023). MPXV replicates through a complex process, however it is generally thought to be similar to that of other OPVs. The entry receptors of MPXV are yet to be fully discovered. Nonetheless, it is supposed that the entry of MPXV is reliant on host cell type as well as viral strain as well as involves many surface receptors including chondroitin sulfate or heparan sulfate (Pickup, 2015).

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF MPXV

GLOBAL EPIDEMIOLOGY

During the time of initial identification, 282 human cases were reported in Zaire between 1980 and 1985. The age range of the affected individuals was from 1 month to 69 years, where 90% of them were under 15 years of age. However, there was an 11% mortality rate in unvaccinated patients along with an increased rate in children (15%), while no death was reported in vaccinated individuals (Karagoz et al., 2023). A study also reported an increased case fatality rate among the young children as compared to general population (Islam et al., 2022a). Immunization against smallpox typically provides protection against Mpox, however smallpox eradication and consequent reduction in the vaccination campaign hindered the cross-protective immunity against Mpox. Lack of proper MPXV reporting from rural Africa leads to an underestimated threatening potential of MPXV. Following an under-reported period of 39 years in Nigeria’s Bayelsa State, MPXV re-emerged in 2017, which was then supposedly exported to Israel and other countries through travelers. Subsequently, the number of Mpox cases were increased in 2018 and 2019. A number of factors played a role in the MPXV outbreak outside Africa including direct contact with infected monkeys, travelling, shipping, and importation, or susceptible populations with a risk of contracting Mpox. Moreover, smallpox vaccine cessation might also have contributed in increased MPXV transmission from human-to-human. MPXV outbreaks outside Africa indicate the global connection of Mpox infection. Thus, measures are needed to promote diagnosis and monitoring to find out the fluctuating epidemiology of Mpox (Bunge et al., 2022). Mpox not only affected Africa, but also developed countries. In the U.S., two Mpox cases were observed the persons who returned from Nigeria to Texas in July 2021. On May 6, 2022, a British man was also found to be Mpox infected, after his visit to Nigeria. As of September 24, 2024, more than 106 thousand confirmed cases, including in Europe and North America, have been reported. Mpox is commonly detected in western and central Africa; however Mpox cases have been reported in developed countries as well, which indicates that MPXV is spreading globally. According to WHO definitions, a suspected case is someone who is a contact of a confirmed or probable Mpox case in the 21 days before the onset of symptoms or signs including fatigue, profound weakness, back pain, myalgia, headache, acute onset of fever (>38.5°C) (World Health Organization, 2024b). On the other hand, a probable case is someone who exhibits lymphadenopathy, mucosal lesions, unexplained acute skin rash, and has a positive test result for orthopoxviral infection, had several and/or casual sexual partners in the 3 weeks before onset of symptoms, and has an epidemiological link to a confirmed or probable case of Mpox in the 21 days before onset of symptoms (World Health Organization, 2024b). A confirmed Mpox case requires laboratory-confirmed Mpox virus by detection of unique Mpox DNA sequences through real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and/or sequencing (World Health Organization, 2024b). All MPXV-infected cases took place because of travelling to Africa or through animal shipping. In the U.S. alone, around 29,980 probable and confirmed cases and 80 mortalities have been reported. Collectively, these findings suggest that Mpox is a global threat, which further indicates the necessity of developing a strategic plan to avert Mpox from becoming a pandemic (Karagoz et al., 2023).

SAUDI ARABIA EPIDEMIOLOGY

Limited data is available regarding Mpox epidemiology in SA. Assiri et al (Assiri et al., 2024). investigated the continued Mpox occurrence in SA after removal of public health emergency (between July 2022 and May 2023) of Mpox by WHO (Assiri et al., 2024). The researchers investigated 381 cases of Mpox in SA from May to September 2023. They found that 91.1% of the Mpox-affected individuals are males with an average age of 32.4 (± 8.3) years. Out of 381 individuals, 379 (99.5%) individuals were not associated with secondary cases, 277 (72.7%) individuals refused engagement in extra-marital sex, and 356 (93.4%) of them did not report travelling. Headache was experienced by 314 (82.4%) individuals, while fever was present in 371 (97.4%) cases. In terms of lesions, the most commonly affected areas include the mouth (160 cases, 42%), face (198 cases, 52%), genitals (206 cases, 54%), and palms and soles (297 cases, 78%). All of the genotyped samples were found to be subclade IIb (Assiri et al., 2024). In a different study at King Saud Medical City (KSMC), Dar et al. provided a detailed report of 16 confirmed Mpox cases detected in Riyadh, SA between June and September 2023. The diagnosis and management of confirmed and suspected cases were carried out by following guidelines developed by Saudi Public Health Authority (Weqaya) (Ministry of Health, 2023), Among these 16 laboratory-confirmed cases, 2 were Saudi, 9 Pakistani, 2 Bangladeshi, 2 Indian and one Yemini. In addition, 14 out of 16 affected individuals are migrant workers in SA for over 1 year. The average age of the confirmed individuals was 33.9 years and 15 of them were males. No mortality or substantial complications were reported among the patients (Dar et al., 2023).

PATHOGENESIS OF MPXV

Mpox is a highly contagious disease that can be transmitted from animal-to-human or human-to-human through close contact of any kind, which is regarded as the first step in the pathogenesis and pathogenicity of MPXV. There are several ways through which MPXV can be transmitted from person to person. Different modes of transmission have been further discussed in the “Transmission of MPXV” section. The entry of MPXV particles into host cells is the first step of viral pathogenesis in humans. A number of studies have been carried out to elucidate the interaction between MPXV and response of host cells, which suggests significant genetic diversity in the clade-specific genes across Clade I and II. Indeed, this variation plays a role in the pathogenicity showed by these entities. MPXV genome is composed of several genes that are responsible for encoding host-response modifier proteins. Mpox inhibitor of complement enzymes (MOPICE) are considered as the virulence factors of MPXV. It has been observed that the MOPICE protein has a significant contribution in elevating pathogenicity in the case of Clade I, while Clade II is lacking this protein. In the human body, MPXV can be introduced through various routes, such as intradermal routes, respiratory routes, or during sexual intercourse (Choudhary et al., 2022a). On August 17, 2024, The Public Health Authority (Weqaya) released a statement that no Clade I case has been detected in SA (Abid, 2024). The MPXV multiplies at the site of inoculation and then spreads into blood, lymph nodes, bone marrow, spleen, and tonsils, which eventually results in primary viremia and MPXV transportation into skin and testes (Hatmal et al., 2022). It has been revealed by in vivo studies that the primary sites of MPXV replication include lymphoid tissues in the throat and neck. Following this primary MPXV replication, it further infects the liver and spleen (Lum et al., 2022). MPXV also infects Langerhans cells, dendrites, and macrophages (
Figure 2
), which eventually results in inflammation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts (Cann et al., 2013). MPXV enters or invades the host cells either through macropinocytosis or a fusion mechanism. Indeed, the MPXV entry and release mechanisms are complicated owing to the co-occurrence of two different viral forms including IMV and EEV, which are enclosed by diverse lipid bilayers and show characteristic surface proteins (Saied et al., 2022a; Islam et al., 2023).

TRANSMISSION OF MPXV

Some primates and rodents in central Africa serve as the natural Mpox hosts. Early MPXV infections took place owing to contact with infected animals, such as consumption of undercooked meat or exposure to tissues, body fluids, and mucous membranes. In addition, MPXV transmission can take place via bites or scratches from infected animals. Direct contact with respiratory droplets from infected persons is thought to be responsible for MPXV human-to-human transmission (Upadhayay et al., 2022; Beeson et al., 2023). Moreover, vertical transmission of MPXV can take place from infected mothers to their infants (Adler and Taggart, 2022; Billioux et al., 2022). Unlike previous Mpox outbreaks, the recent outbreak was the major reported Mpox outbreak outside of Africa. Previously, MPXV infection was only observed following traveling to Mpox-affected counties or after contact with infected animals (Kumar et al., 2023). Nonetheless, most of the confirmed Mpox cases of the current outbreak are not linked with travelling or direct contact with infected animals, but rather linked with sexual intercourse between individuals. Furthermore, it was observed that most of the Mpox cases were detected in bisexual or homosexual males. It has also been reported that 98% of the Mpox cases were observed among bisexual or homosexual males and 41% of them had co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Moreover, 73% of the lesions were observed in the genital and anal regions (del Rio and Malani, 2022). Substantial challenges for accurate diagnosis are faced because of this prolonged incubation period, which can further result in further MPXV transmission, disease progression, and delayed medical attention (Accordini et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2023; Reda et al., 2023).

CLINICAL PRESENTATION

Mpox infections can widely vary ranging from self-limiting and mild illness to a severe form of the disease in immunocompromised individuals with life-threatening conditions (Gessain et al., 2022; Mitjà et al., 2022; Titanji et al., 2022). The average MPXV incubation period ranges from 2 days to 3 weeks. On the other hand, the average incubation period during the clade IIb outbreak was found to range from 7-10 days (Miura et al., 2022; Tarín-Vicente et al., 2022). After an asymptomatic incubation period and before the appearance of a rash, Mpox patients usually have prodromal symptoms for 1-5 days including headache (25%-55%), malaise (23%-57%), myalgias (31%-55%), lymphadenopathy (56%-86%), and fever (62%-72%) (Patel et al., 2022; Philpott et al., 2022; Tarín-Vicente et al., 2022). Nonetheless, the timing of prodromal symptoms was found to be variable during the 2022 clade IIb outbreak, which arose after, before, or during the occurrence of the rash or other presenting symptoms (for example- proctitis) (Patel et al., 2022; Titanji et al., 2024). Painful skin lesion is the most common Mpox clinical feature that consistently advances through four distinct stages over two to four weeks. Typically, lesions start as macules and develop into pustules, vesicles, and papules, which desquamate and crust in the final stage. Individuals with Mpox remain infectious from the onset of clinical symptoms till all skin lesions are re-epithelialized, which usually takes up to four weeks. Mpox rash typically takes place in a centrifugal distribution, where lesions are observed in limbs, trunk, and face. Nonetheless, in the recent global outbreak, MPXV transmission predominantly occurred through sexual contact, which often resulted in anogenital and genital (36%-73%) as well as oral and perioral lesions (14%-25%), along with painful mucosal lesions at any site, limited (median number of 10) lesions, and nonuniform development of lesions (Patel et al., 2022; Thornhill et al., 2022; Titanji et al., 2024). Other complications including ocular disease, urethritis, pharyngitis (13%-36%), and proctitis (14%-36%) were also observed in Mpox individuals (Patel et al., 2022; Thornhill et al., 2022; Titanji et al., 2024). In addition, less than 5% of Mpox individuals show mucosal symptoms (pharyngitis or proctitis) without skin lesions or a single skin lesion without other symptoms. In healthcare workers, localized single lesions were reported at the site of a needle-stick injury (Choi et al., 2023; Titanji et al., 2024).

MPOX SCENARIO IN SAUDI ARABIA

In SA, the first laboratory-confirmed human Mpox case was reported on 14 July 2022 in Riyadh and a total of 8 confirmed cases as of 30 June 2024. Indeed, preventive measures are essential to prevent the MPXV transmission, which will further prevent an upcoming pandemic (Shoaib, 2023). In the beginning, there were no explicit guidelines for monitoring and regulating the transmission of MPXV in SA (Meo et al., 2022a). However, subsequently the Saudi Arabian MOH developed guidelines and implemented measures to control and monitor MPXV transmission in SA (Ajman et al., 2022). Saudi Arabian MOH contributed significantly in implementing and coordinating steps to regulate the COVID-19 pandemic in SA through international collaborations, vaccination campaigns, public communication, resource allocation, policy decisions, and influential leadership, which further resulted in decreased severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS−CoV−2) transmission and eventually protected public health (Kamarudin et al., 2023; Hershan, 2024).

In a similar manner, Saudi Arabian MOH also has taken measures to control the spread of MPXV (Alshahrani et al., 2022a). If there is any suspected or confirmed Mpox case, it is more likely that MOH will take various preventive measures including contact tracing, isolation of the infected individuals, and monitoring of healthcare workers who might have come into the contact of MPXV. MOH has also conducted various public awareness campaigns to raise public awareness regarding the Mpox signs and symptoms in order to prevent Mpox transmission. Moreover, MOH has also considered offering the smallpox vaccines to high-risk populations, including healthcare professionals and people travelling to regions or countries where Mpox is endemic (Ajman et al., 2022). In a study in SA, Alshahrani et al (Alshahrani et al., 2022b). assessed the knowledge level of doctors about the Mpox. They reported that participant doctors exhibited highest knowledge level in clinical presentation 69.3% and disease transmission 70.4%. Nonetheless, the participants showed a lower level of knowledge (49.5%) in control and preventive measures. In addition, most of the participants showed positive attitudes toward controlling and preventing MPXV, where 84.1% of participants believed that with appropriate preventive measures, Mpox could be effectively controlled. Collectively, these findings suggested that it is essential to ameliorate the knowledge level of Saudi Arabian healthcare professionals regarding Mpox for effective control and prevention. Moreover, these measures not only will facilitate early identification and management of Mpox cases, but also the prevention of Mpox outbreaks (Shoaib, 2023).

In a different study, Meo et al (Meo et al., 2022a). assessed the attitudes, knowledge, awareness, public perception, and acceptance of immunization against pandemic threats including Mpox among 1020 study participants from Riyadh, SA. The researchers summarized that an increased number of study participants in favor of vaccination campaigns (62.8%) and implementation of preventive measures (43.7%) against Mpox. Therefore, improving public awareness and increased availability of information regarding Mpox are like to have significant contributions in strengthening the community to combat MPXV infections and lower the impact of Mpox in SA. Over 1.8 million pilgrims visited SA to perform Hajj and Umrah in 2023 alone, therefore it was challenging for responsible authorities to screen each traveler. Therefore, government health authorities of SA should strongly collaborate with various international health organizations including WHO to prevent, manage or monitor potential health risks at most of the entry points in SA including highways, seaports, and airports by ensuring adherence to hygiene protocols, vaccinations, and health screenings (Ajman et al., 2022; Shoaib, 2023).

DIAGNOSTIC TESTING FOR MPXV THAT CAN BE USED IN SAUDI ARABIA

REAL-TIME PCR

Any person satisfying the definition of a suspected case ought to be offered testing as per the guidelines of the U.S. CDC and WHO. In the case of lab-based diagnosis of Mpox, RT-PCR is regarded as the gold standard diagnostic method for samples derived from either wild animals or parents (Kulesh et al., 2004). A number of RT-PCR assays have been established for MPXV diagnosis after the emergence of Mpox. These RT-PCR methods have been developed for different targets in the MPXV genome including N3R, B6R, F3L, B7R, G2R, and TNF receptor gene. Clinical samples were used to evaluate the diagnostic validation. Most of the RT-PCR tests have a limit of detection (LoD) in the range of 250 to 10 copies per reaction (Shchelkunov et al., 2011). U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization of 7 RT-PCR-based tests so far (da Silva et al., 2023).

LOOP-MEDIATED ISOTHERMAL AMPLIFICATION

Although RT-PCR is regarded as the gold standard diagnostic method for Mpox, there are several drawbacks of these methods, such as the need for consistent access to electricity, technical expertise, long sample processing time, and usage of an advanced thermocycler for identification and amplification of MPXV genome (da Silva et al., 2019; Matthews et al., 2020; da Silva et al., 2021). Therefore, RT-PCR is inappropriate for dispersed applications, especially in middle- and low-income countries (da Silva et al., 2019). Easy-to-use as well as reliable assays and Point-of-Care Testing (POCT) are required to combat Mpox, particularly as the Mpox circulates in middle- and low-income countries. Considering all these issues, isothermal techniques including loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) might be the most outstanding methods for rapid Mpox detection (Da Silva et al., 2020a, 2020b). LAMP is a powerful, simple, low-cost, and rapid technique for rapid nucleic acid amplification at an isothermal and single temperature (for example- 60–65°C), which indicates that this method can be performed without the need for expensive equipment. Collectively, these features are extremely preferable for POCT usage in areas with limited laboratory facilities (da Silva et al., 2023).

SEROLOGICAL TESTING

When a test is carried out in isolation, it is advised to use serology for the clinical MPXV diagnosis to detect antibodies in serum or plasma (Gilchuk et al., 2016). The effectiveness of serological tests specific for MPXV is decreased via the potential for cross-reactivity with antibodies against other OPVs and those exhibited via vaccination, whether historical or recent. Therefore, it is indicated that serological testing should be limited to reference laboratories till further validation is given for the usage of serological or antibody-detecting POCTs outside such settings. When a serologically validated testing facility is available within a reference laboratory, the IgM detection in recently acutely ill individuals or IgG detection in paired serum specimens obtained at least 3 weeks apart from the initial sample collection during the first week of illness can enhance the accuracy of the diagnostic method, when results of other tests are inconclusive (Dubois et al., 2012). In the diagnostic framework, this technique highlights the importance of serology and its potential uses in certain conditions and within the limits of application standards and rigorous validation (Branda et al., 2024).

CRISPR/CAS-BASED SYSTEMS

CRISPR-Cas systems are alternative emerging approaches of nucleic acid detection techniques that have simple device structure, high sensitivity and specificity, and outstanding compatibility with several methods for readout including fluorescence or lateral flow assays (LFAs) (Gootenberg et al., 2017, 2018; Broughton et al., 2020; De Puig et al., 2021; Kaminski et al., 2021). Extensive advancement has been achieved in the design of molecular diagnostic-based approaches by utilizing CRISPR/Cas components (Kaminski et al., 2021). The CRISPR/Cas systems detect viral nucleic acids based on their DNA or RNA sequences and then eradicate them by utilizing Cas enzyme-associated endonuclease function (Kaminski et al., 2021). The two groups of CRISPR systems were rapidly utilized for diagnostic purposes including DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter (DETECTR) and specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking (SHERLOCK) (Gootenberg et al., 2018; Broughton et al., 2020; da Silva et al., 2023). Several studies already reported the potential of CRISPR-Cas systems in the detection of Mpox (Siegrist et al., 2020; Low et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023).

WHOLE-GENOME SEQUENCING

WGS is a powerful, next-generation, and comprehensive sequencing technology that sequences the entire genome of an organism. WGS is considered as the most precise method in distinguishing MPXV from other OPVs, which provides extensive coverage of pathogens beyond other molecular techniques (Farlow et al., 2010). This method also promotes advanced virological study, allows comprehensive bioinformatic investigations, and the design as well as development of relevant immunoassays. WGS is a powerful method for detecting unknown transmission chains, specific genetic variants and strains, and possibly revealing the origin of an outbreak (Sharma et al., 2022; Vazquez et al., 2024). genetic evolution of MPXV can also be traced by analyzing WGS data, which can provide more data on MPXV adaptation across varied environments and hosts as well as detection of genetic markers for severe disease manifestations or antiviral resistance. Furthermore, WGS allows high-resolution mapping of MPXV biogeography and phylogeny and deducing patterns of the MPXV migration by comparing genome sequences derived from a range of outbreaks. There is a growing interest on WGS because of its potential in epidemiologic research, vaccine development, disease treatment, and development of targeted outbreak control and prevention approaches. Nonetheless, operational cost of WGS is high and it needs extensive computational resources, which restricts its uses in large-scale testing. There are several challenges in WGS applications, such as scientific, ethical, and practical considerations, as well as the requirement of thoughtful policymaking and constant development. Thus, WGS is not suitable as POCT because of these limitations. WGS mainly benefits specific case investigations and research initiatives as well as the creation of MPXV databases to enhance findings (Branda et al., 2024).

ELECTRON MICROSCOPY

Electron microscopy can mediate the visual detection of potential MPXV within specimens. Nonetheless, because of the need for expensive research facilities, the requirement of specific technical expertise, and the emergence of more available molecular methods, this method is not widely used in MPXV diagnosis (Gentile and Gelderblom, 2005). Therefore, electron microscopy is not routinely used in the diagnosis of poxviruses (Branda et al., 2024).

VIRUS ISOLATION AND CULTURE

Virus isolation and culture are time-consuming approaches that can be useful in diagnosing Mpox. This method can provide comprehensive characterization via sequencing, which can provide vital insights crucial for the developments of clinical applications, vaccines, research methodologies, and antiviral testing (Reed et al., 2004). MPXV isolation from important cases can mediate outbreak investigation and control measures via detecting the MPXV origin, reconstructing transmission chains, and pinpointing mutations via phenotypic and genomic comparisons among isolates. Indeed, MPXV shows vigorous growth in various mammalian cell lines including RK-13, BSC-1, Vero, and HeLa, as well as in chicken embryos (Erez et al., 2019). In chicken embryos, MPXV stimulates cytopathic activities in the chorioallantois membranes, which is more prominent in 1–4 days post-inoculation, including syncytium formation, cytoplasmic bridging, granulation, and cell rounding. On the other hand, typical detached and rounded cells become more noticeable in Vero cells within around 24 h, which allows identification of virus particles by specific antibodies and immunofluorescence. Notwithstanding the accuracy of this method, this method is not widely used because of the need for high-level biosafety labs (level 3 or higher), the risk of infection even after wearing adequate personal protection, the necessity for skilled personnel, and the extensive detection timeframe (Branda et al., 2024).

PROPHYLACTIC MEASURES THAT CAN BE TAKEN IN SAUDI ARABIA TO PREVENT MPOX

PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS

INDIVIDUALS

People in SA might also play a role in limiting MPXV transmission in various ways. Confirmed or suspected individuals ought to stay home and avoid contact with other people. Immunocompetent people with mild Mpox symptoms ought to avoid contact with other people for 3 to 6 weeks (Suñer et al., 2023). In addition, healthy individuals ought to avoid intimate contact with Mpox-infected individuals. People should also maintain cough etiquettes, wear a fitted mask, practice good hand hygiene, and sneeze with a piece of cloth or tissue or by bending arms. Appropriate disinfection and cleaning of high-touch areas are suggested after having home visitors. Moreover, practicing safe sexual intercourse and having less sexual partners might help in limiting MPXV transmission. According to the CDC, around half of the individuals who are at greater risk have changed their sexual activities and the number of their sexual partners (Gupta et al., 2023).

SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS AND PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS

Health Electronic Surveillance Network (HESN) is an electronic health information system of SA, that provides various public health data including immunization, vaccination, and epidemic outbreak (Alqifari et al., 2022). According to Ministry of Health (MOH) strict guidelines, any suspected Mpox cases must need to be reported by the healthcare facilities using HESN (Ministry of Health, 2023). This surveillance system ought to monitor suspected cases in SA and travelers from areas where Mpox is endemic (Shoaib, 2023). Confirmed or suspected Mpox cases ought to be isolated to avert the transmission of Mpox to others (
Figure 3
), this isolation is especially crucial in healthcare facilities where the risk of MPXV transmission is higher (Shoaib, 2023). Public awareness campaigns also need to be conducted by the SA government to educate the community regarding the Mpox signs and symptoms and methods to avert MPXV transmission (Shoaib, 2023).

HEALTHCARE WORKERS

Mpox prevention in clinical settings is more challenging since the healthcare workers remain in contact with infected individuals (Guarner et al., 2022). Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including gowns, masks, and gloves should be provided to healthcare workers to provide protection from Mpox exposure. Immediate masking of the confirmed or suspected individuals is also essential. Furthermore, skin lesions of the affected individuals also need to be covered with a cloth or gown and these individuals need to be isolated preferably in a negative-pressure-containing single-person room in the hospital. Workers should wear gloves while handling the laundry of Mpox-infected individuals (Guarner et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2023).

VACCINES

There is no Mpox-specific vaccine available currently. However, studies have reported that smallpox vaccines can provide up to 85% protection against Mpox (Kuroda et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024). Moreover, epidemiological data suggest that increased occurrence of Mpox was observed in individuals who were born post-smallpox pandemic and eradication period or never been infected by poxviruses or never received smallpox vaccination in childhood (Malik et al., 2023a). At present, there are 2 approved smallpox vaccines used against Mpox. Pre- and post-prophylaxis immunizations for a certain group of people are recommended by various healthcare authorities including the Advisory Committee and Immunization Practices (ACIP) (Choudhary et al., 2022b; Meo et al., 2022b). FDA-approved vaccines including JYNNEOS™ and ACAM2000® are recommended for healthcare professionals who are supposedly exposed to OPVs (
Table 1
) (Mahase, 2022; Payne et al., 2022). These healthcare professionals include scientists researching clinical Mpox samples, diagnostic and vaccination teams, response teams against outbreaks, clinical personnel associated with viral disease management, and laboratory workers as well as technicians. Therefore, proper vaccination guidelines should be developed in SA to ensure the safety of these healthcare professionals. In addition to the aforementioned 2 vaccines, Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine (APSV) is also approved for emergency uses when the two other vaccines are unavailable or contradicted for application. Smallpox vaccines were previously effectively used to prevent Mpox. As there is no report or literature currently available that shows the use of smallpox vaccine by the SA health authorities in Saudi Arabia, therefore SA government might offer smallpox vaccine to high-risk groups, including healthcare workers and individuals travelling to regions where Mpox is known to occur. Collectively, SA health authorities should continue to collaborate with international organizations including WHO to implement preventive strategies and measures to efficiently control the spread of MPXV in order to avoid the next Mpox pandemic (Shoaib, 2023).

POST-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS

Post-exposure prophylaxis is recommended for individuals following their contact with the skin or mucous membrane of an infected person or with their bedding, clothing, oral cavity, lesions, saliva, and bodily fluids (Mahase, 2022). People can be exposed to MPXV through viral presence in air particles and aerosol secretions, when they share a close space for a longer period (3 hours or more) (Islam et al., 2022c). Moreover, CDC and FDA recommend post-exposure vaccination only for high-degree exposures, where there is a possible risk of contracting MPXV (Islam et al., 2022c; Payne et al., 2022). Furthermore, the deficiency of medical masks and protective gloves or contact-used material without post- and pre-exposure sanitization is a condition that necessitates and sensitizes vaccination. It is recommended to go through monitoring or diagnosis before post-exposure prophylaxis, in cases of lower exposure rates or uncertain exposure (Bachmann and See, 2022; Islam et al., 2022c; Mahase, 2022). MPXV transmission can occur due to extended interaction with symptomatic individuals or infected animals. Therefore, according to CDC, post-exposure immunization should be carried out after around 4 days and within 4–14 days to prevent Mpox development (Bachmann and See, 2022; Payne et al., 2022). However, if vaccination is conducted after 2 weeks, only the disease burden can be reduced but the onset of Mpox cannot be averted (Bachmann and See, 2022; Raccagni et al., 2022; Saied et al., 2022b).

THERAPEUTICS FOR MPOX TREATMENT THAT CAN BE USED IN SAUDI ARABIA

ANTIVIRAL AGENTS

TRIFLURIDINE

Trifluridine is a thymidine analog that acts as an antiviral drug by suppressing DNA synthesis. This antiviral drug suppresses DNA polymerase and also gets incorporated into DNA molecules, Nonetheless, trifluridine action might lack selectivity. In the case of Mpox, this drug is only used as a topical preparation on the eyes of infected individuals. Trifluridine does not cross the intact cornea, therefore it is considered safe when this drug is used as eye drops. Nonetheless, this drug might cross the cornea and be noticeable in aqueous humor in case of corneal pathologies disrupting its structure. Various mild adverse reactions have been reported with the use of trifluridine, including allergy, inflammation of the cornea, oedema of the eyelids, and temporary local burning sensation. The dosing interval of trifluridine is 2 hours until the complete regeneration of corneal epithelium. After the regeneration, it might be taken once every 4 hours for another 1 week. Nevertheless, trifluridine is not recommended to be used for a longer term. Alternative drugs might be selected if treatment is required beyond 3 weeks (Shamim et al., 2023). Cash-Goldwasser et al (Cash-Goldwasser et al., 2022). and Perzia et al (Perzia et al., 2022). carried out studies with trifluridine in the Mpox treatment. Nonetheless, this drug was used by the researchers in these studies as an add-on agent. In general, 5 participants received both tecovirimat and trifluridine (through topical route). Mpox clinical presentations of four participants varied greatly, but all of them exhibited ophthalmological manifestations. These 4 patients quickly recovered and were discharged. However, reduced visual acuity and worsened ocular symptoms were exhibited by one patient. Overall, no adverse events were observed with trifluridine (Cash-Goldwasser et al., 2022; Perzia et al., 2022).

BRINCIDOFOVIR

Brincidofovir is a prodrug of cidofovir that acts as an antiviral drug by selectively suppressing the activity of OPV DNA polymerase (
Figure 2
). Therefore, this drug was found to be efficient against DNA viruses. Brincidofovir is a lipid conjugate of cidofovir. It has been observed that lipid acylic nucleoside phosphonate plays a role as a phospholipid in the body and reduces the development of lesions with no confirmed effect with coupled vaccination (Hutson et al., 2021; McCarthy, 2022; Kuroda et al., 2023). Patients were reported to be completely recovered with minimal side effects. Therefore, this drug is approved to treat cytomegalovirus retinitis in HIV individuals and also approved to treat smallpox and other related infections. Brincidofovir is also a preferred drug for widespread administration during an emergency Mpox outbreak. As compared to cidofovir, brincidofovir has no reported nephrotoxicity and provides better oral bioavailability, thus brincidofovir received approval for oral administration (Hutson et al., 2021; McCarthy, 2022; Malik et al., 2023b). Nonetheless, the profile of liver enzymes needs to be strictly monitored and liver function tests need to be carried out for the treatment. Moreover, brincidofovir is not recommended for newborns, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals because of the hyperactive drug accumulation (Altindis et al., 2022). Animal studies already demonstrated its effectiveness against Mpox, however more clinical studies are required for proper licensure and approval (Bachmann and See, 2022; Malik et al., 2023a).

TECOVIRIMAT

Tecovirimat is an antiviral agent, which originally received FDA approval in 2018 to treat smallpox infection (Guarner et al., 2022). Tecovirimat can block the formation of the viral envelope by suppressing p37 polypeptide (
Figure 2
), which is a highly conserved sequence among all OPVs (Russo et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022). As MPXV is an OPV, therefore tecovirimat might exhibit an antiviral role against Mpox. Mpox patients in the U.S. can obtain tecovirimat from state, county, or city health authorities through an FDA- and CDC-approved expanded access–investigational new drug protocol (Guarner et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2023).

CIDOFOVIR

Cidofovir is effective against several DNA viruses and it acts as an antiviral drug by terminating DNA polymerase-based replication in the form of 5′-diphosphorylated metabolite (
Figure 2
). Cidofovir was found to be effective against infections caused by smallpox, Mpox (
Table 2
), VACV, and HIV (Al Jurdi and Kotton, 2022). Routes of administration of cidofovir include intravenous (IV) and topical routes. Indeed, cidofovir not only reduces the symptoms by preventing the formation of lesions, but also decreases mortality rates. In addition, cidofovir is used to treat severe VACV as a second-line therapy (Hutson et al., 2021; Malik et al., 2023b). Cidofovir was found to result in nephrotoxicity following IV administration, this drug should be administered along with probenecid and adequate hydration. Furthermore, proper dose adjustment along with renal functional considerations are needed to manage nephrotoxicity. Nonetheless, more clinical studies are required with cidofovir to confirm its potential against Mpox (Thakur, 2022; Malik et al., 2023a).

IMMUNOMODULATORS

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are commonly used to treat orthopoxvirus infections, which can also be used to treat severe infections caused by MPXV (Xiao and Isaacs, 2010). It has been revealed that interferon beta can significantly suppress the Mpox generation and spread. Therefore, recombinant beta can be used as a safe and novel agent in Mpox treatment. More mAbs also need to be developed to elevate the potency of immunoglobulin therapy and/or specific antiviral drugs that may ameliorate outcomes of individuals with severe combined immunodeficient individuals (Johnston et al., 2012; Piparva et al., 2024).

IMMUNOGLOBULIN THERAPY

In 2005, Vaccinia immunoglobulin IV (VIGIV) was first approved for clinical uses in treating complications associated with the use of smallpox vaccinations (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, 2005; Piparva et al., 2024). Several recombinant immunoglobulins (rVIG) are currently being studied. rVIGs act in a strategic passive immunotherapy manner. VIG’s two IV formulations including VIGIV Dynport and VIGIV Cangene are being studied and yet to be licensed (O’Laughlin et al., 2022; Turner et al., 2022). It was previously utilized effectively in refractive cases. As a hyperimmune immunoglobulin, it plays a role in neutralizing virus particles and decreasing viremia and mortality rates by up to 30% to 40% (Payne et al., 2022). In order to develop passive immunity, antibodies are obtained from the plasma of smallpox-immune people. It is also used in individuals with immunodeficiency, since it has adequate maltose to perhaps raises revaccination needs, needs attention for renal insufficient profiles, might interfere with serological testing, and affect insulin levels and glycemic conditions (Bachmann and See, 2022). Since there is a lack of human trial data regarding Mpox treatment, therefore more studies are required in this regard (Malik et al., 2023a).

CHALLENGES AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

Despite being a member of the DNA virus family, Mpox shows incredibly greater genomic variability because of elevated nucleotide polymorphism. Increased international travel and rapid population mobility have mediated the spread of Mpox among people, which is further facilitating its potential for mutation (Lu et al., 2023). In addition, these factors also play a role in drug resistance, increased variability, and appearance of multidrug-resistant strains of the Mpox virus (Kmiec and Kirchhoff, 2022). Future studies on Mpox in SA can result in a better understanding of Mpox and its potential to cause public health threats, which will also reduce knowledge gaps. A future Mpox pandemic might involve a serious burden in the case of economic development, social activities, education systems, and healthcare facilities. Although there is a deficiency of information regarding the specific impact of a Mpox pandemic, some findings indicated the need for assessment of the economic burden of Mpox treatment in healthcare settings, such as costs associated with hospitalization, public health interventions, medications, and diagnostics (Shoaib, 2023). Analysis of these factors in SA might aid the estimation of financial resources needed for effective Mpox outbreak management. Moreover, investigation is also required for the potential Mpox impact on the productivity of the workforce in various sectors (such as services, manufacturing, agriculture, and healthcare) because of reduced productivity, absenteeism, and illness.

CONCLUSIONS

In this review, important insights have been provided regarding epidemiology, transmissions, clinical presentation, diagnostic tests, prophylactic measures and therapeutic options of Mpox from SA perspective. Recent Mpox outbreaks around the world have emphasized the necessity for vigilant and constant monitoring in SA. Mpox cases in SA were found to be travel-associated and showed potential close contact and heterosexual transmission. Novel therapeutic and prophylactic measures are also needed to be continuously appraised for the potential implications in SA. Selective usage of smallpox vaccines in the SA population can also be considered to limit MPXV spread. Moreover, lessons learned from the Covid-19 pandemic should be applied in the containment and management of Mpox in SA.
Mpox 2022 to 2025 Update: A Comprehensive Review on Its Complications, Transmission, Diagnosis, and Treatment

Abstract

Monkeypox virus (Mpox virus) is a zoonotic orthopoxvirus that has gained increased global attention due to recent outbreaks. The current review reports the latest update of Mpox cases from 25 February 2022 to 29 April 2025. It also evaluates the possible major complications in human life caused by Mpox. In early 2022, more than 40 countries reported Mpox outbreaks. As of 12 June 2024, the global case count for the 2022–2023 Mpox outbreak was 97,281 confirmed cases, in 118 countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Mpox virus, a zoonotic disease, a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 14 August 2024. Mpox symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, and face-to-body rashes. The review also highlights Mpox virus replication, genomics, pathology, transmission, diagnosis, and antiviral therapies. The 2022 outbreak is also discussed in detail. The coinfection of HIV in patients infected with Mpox is also discussed. The evolving Mpox epidemiology has raised concerns about the disease’s increasing spread in non-endemic countries, emphasizing the urgent need for control and prevention. The discussion on preventive measures, including vaccination, suggests that cross-protection against Mpox may be possible using orthopoxvirus-specific antibodies. Although there are no specific antiviral drugs available, certain drugs, such as tecovirimat, cidofovir, and ribavirin, are worth considering.

1. INTRODUCTION

Monkeypox is a viral disease caused by the Mpox virus. According to the latest report (29 April 2025) of the World Health Organization (WHO) globally, 137,892 confirmed cases of Mpox have been reported from 1 January 2022 to 31 March 2025. Out of these, 317 deaths were confirmed across 132 countries [1]. Mpox virus is an enveloped double-stranded DNA with around 200 kb of nucleotides, which is brick-shaped and has a tubule-like structure on its surface [2]. Additionally, it has a dumbbell-shaped core structure that measures up to 200 to 250 nm. This virus belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus (OPXV) and the family of poxviridae [3]. Mpox resembles smallpox, and the disease is spread via zoonosis. There are two clades of Mpox: clade I (formerly the Central African clade or the Congo Basin clade) and Clade II (formerly the West African clade). Both have a sequence similarity of about 95%. The fatality rate of clade I is three times higher than that of clade II [4]. Mpox has a linear DNA genome that contains around 190 non-overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) [5]. Mpox genomes contain a highly conserved central region, while the terminal region is highly variable, having inverted terminal repeats (ITR) [6]. All Mpox viruses have four ORFs in the ITR region [5,7]. The gene loss at the terminal region acts as a driving force for the evolution of the new Mpox. The ultrastructural analysis study in 2022 revealed that virus replication occurs in the mini-nucleus, which is reorganized by endoplasmic reticulum cisternae in the host cell. The early mRNA and late mRNA form in the mini nucleus, which consecutively form the early protein and the late protein. As a result, an intracellular mature virus (IMV) is released in the cytoplasm and comes outside of the cell by exocytosis to form an enveloped extracellular virus or extracellular mature virus (EMV), which is ready to infect another host cell [8] (Figure 1). Mpox is not considered a sexually transmitted disease, although the Mpox virus DNA was detected in semen and seminal fluid samples in Italy and Germany in the 2022 global outbreak. Despite various studies on the Mpox virus, the anal or vaginal route can be considered a mucosal membrane route [9]. Virus mutation and the re-emergence of pathogens with unusual transmission routes may enhance infection and increase the possibility of an epidemic.

Since 2022, two major Mpox outbreaks have prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare public health emergencies of international concern, first in July 2022 and again in August 2024. The initial global spread, attributed to a clade 2b strain, resulted in roughly 100,000 cases and 200 fatalities [10]. Subsequently, a new clade, 1b, emerged, leading to a second surge. As of December 2024, this recent outbreak has seen over 55,000 reported or suspected cases and approximately 1000 deaths, primarily in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring nations such as Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, and Angola [11]. Isolated cases of clade 1b have also been documented in countries including the UK, Sweden, Germany, Belgium, France, the USA, Canada, and Thailand. The details of the outbreaks of 2024 and 2022 are as follows.

1.1. THE 2024 OUTBREAK

The Mpox clade 1b variant, initially detected in the Sud Kivu area of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), has emerged as a major public health threat due to its increased ability to spread between people [12]. Genetic investigation of clade 1b has uncovered numerous mutations of Mpox. The genetic makeup of clade 1b shows several mutations in genes related to the enzyme apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) cytosine deaminase. This enzyme’s involvement is often indicative of sustained human-to-human transmission [13]. These genetic alterations distinguish clade 1b from the traditionally circulating clade I variant, enabling more efficient spread through close physical contact, including sexual contact.

Genetic changes, particularly those linked to APOBEC3, are thought to contribute to clade 1b’s enhanced transmissibility.

Since its initial identification, this variant has expanded its reach within the DRC to other provinces and has also been reported in neighboring nations like Rwanda, Uganda, and Kenya, signifying a considerable geographical expansion of the outbreak [14,15].

The Democratic Republic of Congo was the epicenter and reported 3235 Mpox infections and 19 deaths as of 11 August 2024 [16]. The emergence of the clade 1b Mpox in neighboring Central and East African countries has raised significant concerns about the potential for a wider regional epidemic. Burundi had recorded 545 Mpox alerts by 17 August 2024, and 142 were confirmed positive for the clade Ib Mpox variant. Rwanda confirmed its initial two Mpox infections on 24 July 2024, prompting the Ministry of Health to declare an outbreak on July 27. By 7 August 2024, Rwanda had reported a total of four confirmed cases of the clade 1b variant of Mpox, with no associated deaths. In Uganda, initially, six suspected cases were identified in June 2024, and out of those six, two were confirmed later. As of 13 August 2024, Kenya has identified 14 suspected cases, with one confirmed positive for clade Ib Mpox. To date, no deaths have been reported.

In August 2024, the clade 1b strain’s spread beyond Africa was confirmed for the first time [15]. The virus has also extended its reach to countries in East Africa, Europe, and Asia, underscoring its capacity for worldwide spread [16]. Sweden reported a case involving a traveler returning from an affected region, demonstrating the pivotal role of international travel in spreading infectious diseases globally [17]. This event prompted urgent calls for governments to enhance border checks, implement targeted surveillance, and foster international collaboration to control cross-border disease transmission. On 22 August 2024, Thailand reported its initial Mpox case of a European man with a recent travel history to Africa [18]. Likewise, India’s identification of its first imported clade 1b Mpox case in Kerala highlights the potential for international travel to contribute to the dissemination of this variant.

From November 2024 to 12 February 2025, four cases of clade Ib were detected. In the United States, the first confirmed case of clade Ib Mpox occurred in California in November 2024, following travel to an affected region. A second case was identified in Georgia on 14 January 2025, involving a traveler from a country with ongoing Mpox transmission. Subsequent cases were reported in New Hampshire on 7 February 2025 and in New York on 12 February 2025. These four cases represent independent events, with no epidemiological links established and no evidence of further transmission [19]. The 2024 outbreak emphasized the importance of aligning travel health policies with robust outbreak management strategies to minimize risks from rapidly spreading pathogens [15].

A significant public health crisis unfolded between 2022 and 31 December 2024, with global records documenting over 118,777 Mpox infections [20]. Between 2022 and 2024, the different regions of the Americas documented 67,220 confirmed Mpox cases, resulting in 151 deaths across 31 countries and territories [20]. The majority of these cases occurred in 2022 (57,616, representing 85.7% of the total), followed by a substantial decline in 2023 (4056 cases, 6%). A minor increase was observed in 2024, with 5548 cases (8.3%) [20]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has determined that the highly contagious clade 1b strain is the primary driver of this outbreak, characterized by severe symptoms and increased mortality [21]. The most affected areas that reported a large number of infections were East, Central, West, and Southern Africa, specifically, Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, the Central African Republic (CAR), Ivory Coast, and South Africa [22]. The swift dissemination of the virus in these areas underscores the critical need for collaborative containment efforts and enhanced healthcare systems to effectively address such epidemics.

1.2. THE 2022 OUTBREAK

Before 2022, Mpox cases were documented within the African continent. The first case of the 2022 outbreak of the Mpox outside the African continent was recorded on 6 May 2022 in the United Kingdom [23]. A total of 366 Mpox cases were confirmed in the United Kingdom (UK) until 10 June 2022 [24,25]. On 18 May 2022, Portugal reported 14 Mpox infections, Spain reported seven, and Canada reported 13. The first Mpox cases in Belgium, Sweden, and Italy were confirmed on 19 May 2022. France, Germany, Australia, and the Netherlands each reported their initial Mpox cases on 20 May 2022. Switzerland and Israel each confirmed their initial Mpox cases on May 21. By 24 May 2022, 19 countries had reported cases of Mpox. Among these, the United Arab Emirates identified its first case in late May, involving a 29-year-old female traveler from West Africa. Slovenia also confirmed its initial infection. Denmark’s first case was linked to an individual returning from the Canary Islands. In Canada, Quebec reported fifteen confirmed cases on 24 May, the same day the Czech Republic confirmed its first case [24]. The study published in the New England Journal on 21 July 2022 reported a total of 528 Mpox infections between 27 April and 24 June 2022, at 43 sites within 16 countries [26].

By 27 May 2022, Portugal had confirmed 96 Mpox cases, and the information regarding demographics, clinical presentation, and exposure was collected from all 96 cases via face-to-face and telephone interviews using standardized case investigation forms. A subset of 27 confirmed cases underwent more detailed investigation, and their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, along with available laboratory and epidemiological findings, are summarized in a previous study published in Eurosurveillance in June 2022 [27]. The majority of cases (25 cases) of the 2022 Portugal outbreak resided in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley (LVT) region, with single cases in the North and Algarve regions. All cases were male, ages ranging from 22 to 51 years (majority 30–39). Considering exposures within the 21 days preceding symptom onset, few (1/10) reported contact with individuals exhibiting similar symptoms, and some had a history of international travel (4/27).

Most cases were identified as men who have sex with men (MSM) (18/19), while one reported sex with only women. During the 21 days before symptom onset, most cases with available data (14/16) reported multiple sexual partners. Six cases reported attending a sauna in the LVT region, one frequented a UK sauna, and four reported international travel—three reported contacts with animals (two with cats and one with pigs). Common symptoms included exanthema (fourteen), inguinal lymphadenopathy (fourteen), fever (thirteen), and genital ulcers (six). Fourteen cases were HIV-positive. Three cases required hospitalization, two of whom were later discharged. No deaths were reported by 27 May 2022. One middle-aged case reported prior smallpox vaccination [27].

In May 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency for a previous Mpox outbreak caused by clade IIb of the virus. Almost 48 cases of Mpox were reported from different regions of Latin America, such as Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia, and Chile, by 28 June 2022 [28]. In July 2022, the multi-country Mpox outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to its rapid spread through sexual contact in regions previously unaffected by the virus. This declaration was lifted in May 2023 following a sustained global decline in cases. The outbreak had infected 87,000 people and resulted in 140 deaths. The WHO attributed the successful containment to a combination of vaccination and public health information campaigns [29]. Most of these countries have set up their epidemiological centers for the identification of these viruses. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of 7 February 2024, the maximum number of reported cases in the USA is 31,894, followed by Brazil (10,967), Spain (7752), and France (4171).

The geographical distribution of the Mpox in countries affected in Africa is illustrated in Figure 2a, while the recent trends of Mpox cases in Africa are shown in Figure 2b.

2. HOST RESERVOIRS AND TRANSMISSION

Mpox is a zoonotic disease; Central African rodents and primates are the natural hosts of Mpox. The Mpox virus is primarily transmitted from animals to humans through close contact, such as bites, scratches, or exposure to the animal’s rash, as well as through exposure to their bodily fluids or consumption of improperly cooked meat [30]. Transmission can also occur via contaminated materials (fomites) like bedding or clothing. Historically, human-to-human transmission has been less frequent.

A 2018 case study reported that a man traveling from Nigeria to the UK on September 6th presented with a maculopapular rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy and was subsequently diagnosed with Mpox. One of the three attending healthcare workers developed symptoms, was isolated, and had 134 contacts traced and monitored. Four of these contacts later became ill. This incident demonstrates human-to-human transmission of Mpox from a traveler returning from Nigeria to healthcare staff [31].

Historically, Mpox infection was primarily linked to animal contact or travel to endemic regions. However, the transmission pattern shifted in the 2022 outbreak, with most cases now attributed to sexual contact. Over the last two years (2020–22), predominantly gay and bisexual men have been affected [32]. The study reveals that the risk of public transmission was very low because Mpox virus transmission from human to human requires close contact. Human-to-human transmission of the Mpox virus occurred through direct contact through blood transfusion, respiratory droplet infection, sharing of foods, clothes, and bedding, and sexual activity, especially with male-to-male sex [33].

The Mpox virus may be transmitted from the mother to the fetus during pregnancy, and that type of transmission is called vertical transmission [34]. The different proposed model admits that during the entry of the Mpox virus through the respiratory epithelium in humans, the Mpox virus enters dendritic cells and macrophages, which then enter lymphatic vessels and the lymphatic system. In the same way, when the Mpox virus infects the skin epidermis, it first infects fibroblast cells and Langerhans cells, which move in lymphatic vessels and then into the lymphatic system. In this way, it spreads all over the body and infects the liver, which may cause serious liver problems (Figure 3).

3. COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH MPOX

The various complications that have been observed in Mpox-infected persons are the following.

3.1. NEUROLOGICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC COMPLICATIONS

Mpox infections are associated with potential neurological and mental health complications. Research conducted in Nigeria in 2020 indicated that a quarter of hospitalized Mpox patients experienced psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation [35]. However, it is difficult to isolate these symptoms from the psychological impact of hospitalization and isolation. Neurological issues, including seizures, confusion, and encephalitis, were observed in Mpox patients during the 2022 outbreak, with reported occurrences of 2.7%, 2.4%, and 2%, respectively [36]. Furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed the presence of Mpox-specific IgM antibodies. Studies indicate that neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in 50% of individuals with Mpox infection. Badenoch and colleagues suggest that symptoms occur in more than half of cases [36]. These symptoms may arise from the infection itself or the experience of quarantine [37]. Additionally, research conducted in Iraq has revealed widespread anxiety among the general population concerning the ongoing Mpox outbreak [38]. This research sought to evaluate public awareness, perceptions, and anxiety related to the multi-country Mpox outbreak within the Kurdistan region of Iraq. A digital survey utilizing a convenience sampling approach was conducted from 27 to 30 July 2022. The study included 510 participants. Overall, the population demonstrated a moderate understanding of Mpox, held a neutral attitude toward it, and experienced a moderate level of anxiety. Statistical analysis revealed that demographic factors, including gender, religion, education level, and place of residence, significantly impacted awareness and anxiety levels. Gender and the residential area also played a significant role in shaping attitudes toward Mpox [38].

3.2. DERMATOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS

A common characteristic of Mpox infection is the appearance of skin lesions, particularly in the anogenital region. Skin lesions present as a rash that progresses through distinct stages: initially flat (macular), then raised (popular), and subsequently fluid-filled (vesicular). These lesions typically resolve with crusting within three weeks [39]. A characteristic Mpox rash begins with small, flat (macules) or raised (papules) lesions, typically 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter. These lesions progress over two to three weeks, evolving into fluid-filled vesicles and pus-filled pustules, often with a central depression (umbilication), and eventually form crusts. The vesicles and pustules themselves are generally spherical, ranging from 0.5 to 2 cm in diameter, and are notable for their firm texture, deep skin involvement, and well-defined edges [40].

A hallmark of Mpox is a unique rash characterized by painful or itchy maculopapular lesions that progress into a vesiculopustular eruption [41]. Typically, the rash emerges within one to three days following the onset of initial symptoms. However, variations exist, with some individuals experiencing the rash more than three days after fever onset or concurrently with the fever. Lesions commonly manifest on the face, trunk, extremities, genital region, scalp, palms, and soles. The rash often begins on the face and then spreads outward (centrifugally) to the limbs, palms, soles, and mucous membranes of the mouth, eyes, and genitals. A higher concentration of lesions is generally observed on the face and limbs [42]. In some cases, oral lesions, known as enanthems, may precede the appearance of the skin rash. A comprehensive review of available research indicates that sore throat is the most frequently reported oral symptom of Mpox, while ulceration is the most common oral or peri-oral sign [43].

In one study of 54 patients, all presented with skin lesions, with a significant majority (94%) exhibiting anogenital involvement [44]. A large portion of these patients (89%) reported lesions at multiple anatomical sites, and a smaller percentage (7%) had lesions in the oropharyngeal area. Additionally, a substantial number of patients experienced fatigue (67%) and fever (57%), while a minority (18%) showed no initial symptoms. In some cases, genital ulcers were observed to be painless, accompanied by bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy, resembling the presentation of primary syphilis [45].

A separate international study, tracking 528 Mpox infections in 2022, also identified anogenital lesions as a prevalent symptom. This study found that 73% of patients had anogenital lesions, and 41% presented with mucosal lesions. A rash was observed in 95% of patients, with other frequently reported symptoms including fever (62%), lymphadenopathy (56%), lethargy (41%), muscle aches (31%), and headaches (27% [26]). Due to the varied and evolving clinical presentation of Mpox, especially as seen in the 2022 outbreak, medical professionals, particularly dermatologists, are advised to exercise a high degree of vigilance when evaluating patients with suspected Mpox infection.

The other study, conducted in 101 patients from thirteen countries, shows that 54% of cases have been found with skin lesions. During the initial five days of infection, papules (36%), vesicles (17%), and pustules (20%) were the most frequently observed skin lesions. From days 6–10, pustules became the dominant lesion (36%), followed by erosions/ulcers (27%) and crusts/scabs (24%). After day 11, crusts/scabs were the primary skin manifestation [46].

While monkeypox treatment remains largely symptomatic due to the lack of specific antiviral medications, a novel therapeutic approach combining antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) and photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) successfully treated a large facial cutaneous lesion, highlighting its potential as a promising intervention [47].

3.3. COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO THE COINFECTION OF MPOX VIRUS AND HIV

The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in 2020, demonstrated the rapid emergence of viral diseases and the potential for global spread, highlighting the ongoing threat of Mpox. Mpox may be more lethal for immunocompromised people, such as those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The coinfection of Mpox virus and HIV was first identified and diagnosed in Latin America [48]. In 2022, the recent coinfection of Mpox and acute HIV was also confirmed in a 24-year-old male with outstretched papules throughout the trunk, face, and genital area [49]. A 2023 review in Vaccine reported 6345 confirmed Mpox cases across 53 studies, with a 40.32% HIV co-infection rate [50]. According to WHO, 51% (13,769/26,992) of confirmed cases of Mpox have HIV [51]. The outbreak of Mpox in multiple countries was reported during 2022–24. According to the WHO report, the maximum number of confirmed cases came from the European region (86%), followed by America (11%), the African region (2%), and the Eastern Mediterranean region (1%) [52]. Co-infection with HIV increases the chance of infection in an uninfected person by enhancing the concentration of HIV on genital organs (lesions) and genital secretions or by increasing both factors [53,54]. Individuals living with HIV, especially those with compromised immune systems characterized by low CD4 cell counts (<500 cells per mm3), demonstrate an increased vulnerability to severe Mpox complications and mortality compared to those without HIV. The immunodeficiency resulting from advanced HIV infection elevates the susceptibility to severe Mpox manifestations, which can include necrotizing skin lesions, pulmonary involvement, secondary infections, and sepsis [55].

This study analysed 382 Mpox cases, comprising 367 cisgender males, four cisgender females, and ten transgender females. The median age of the participants was 35 years, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 30 to 43 years. At the time of Mpox diagnosis, 349 individuals (91%) were known to be living with HIV. Among those with HIV, 228 (65%) were adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Concurrent opportunistic infections were observed in 32 participants (8%). The median CD4 cell count was 211 cells/mm3 (IQR 117–291). Specifically, 85 individuals (22%) had CD4 counts below 100 cells/mm3, and 94 individuals (25%) had counts between 100 and 200 cells/mm3. An undetectable viral load was present in 193 participants (51%) [55].

Severe Mpox complications were significantly more prevalent in individuals with CD4 counts below 100 cells/mm3 compared to those with counts exceeding 300 cells/mm3. These complications included the following: necrotizing skin lesions (54% vs. 7%), pulmonary involvement, sometimes with nodules (29% vs. 0%), and secondary infections and sepsis (44% vs. 9%).

Hospitalization was required for 107 participants (28%), with 27 (25%) of those hospitalized resulting in death. All fatalities occurred in individuals with CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm3. Within this group, mortality was higher among those with elevated HIV viral loads. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) related to Mpox was suspected in 21 of the 85 individuals (25%) who initiated or restarted ART, with 12 (57%) of these cases resulting in death. Tecovirimat was administered to 62 participants (16%), while cidofovir or brincidofovir was used in seven participants (2%). Tecovirimat resistance was confirmed in three cases.

3.4. COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH HEART (MYOCARDITIS)

Myocarditis, pericarditis, and myopericarditis have been rarely documented in Mpox infection. Two immunocompetent, unvaccinated adults in the U.S. developed monkeypox-related myocarditis. They were hospitalized and presented with cardiac symptoms (Chest pain) and elevated biomarkers. Oral tecovirimat and doxycycline were provided for the treatment of monkeypox, and they were discharged home after recovery without immediate complications. They received no specific treatment for myocarditis, given the rapid resolution of symptoms and normalization of troponin levels [56].

In a 2022 study, Thornhill et al. documented two instances of self-limiting myocarditis associated with monkeypox, where patients recovered within seven days without significant complications. One of these patients had a history of HIV with a normal CD4 count [26].

A wide range of viruses are known to cause myocarditis, such as Coxsackieviruses and adenoviruses [57]. Viral myocarditis can cause dilated cardiomyopathy. The most frequently observed pathological process involves lymphocytic myocarditis with myocyte necrosis, typically developing 10 to 14 days after the viral infection. The occurrence of myocardial involvement in orthopoxvirus infections was initially documented following smallpox vaccination in young military recruits, using live vaccinia-based vaccines [58]. The precise pathophysiological pathways leading to orthopox-induced myocarditis remain to be determined. Heart failure, arrhythmias, and other cardiovascular-related problems may also be possible in Mpox infection [59].

3.5. HYPOTENSION SEPSIS COMPLICATION

In severe cases, significant fluid loss due to fever, rash, and capillary permeability can occur. The associated systemic inflammatory response may also contribute to hypotension. These factors combine to reduce renal perfusion, potentially leading to acute kidney injury. Vigilant monitoring of urine output and blood chemistry is essential for early detection and to guide the necessity of intravenous fluid replacement.

While infrequent, secondary bacterial infections leading to sepsis have been documented in Mpox-infected patients with Streptococcus pyogenes [60]. Prompt identification of sepsis, utilizing standard diagnostic criteria, is essential. Treatment should adhere to established sepsis management protocols, including initiating broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics within one hour of diagnosis, rapid intravenous fluid resuscitation with ongoing response evaluation, vasoactive medication administration, and appropriate respiratory support [61].

3.6. OCULAR COMPLICATION

Ocular symptoms are uncommon but can cause corneal scarring and vision loss [3]. Manifestations, potentially from self-inoculation, include conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and other ocular inflammations. The 2022 Mpox outbreak showed a significantly lower ocular involvement rate of approximately 1%, compared to 9–23% in prior outbreaks [62]. Mpox can present with a variety of ocular symptoms, including redness, frontal headaches, rashes around the eyes, tearing, discharge, and subconjunctival nodules. Less commonly, it may lead to more severe complications like keratitis, corneal ulcers, opacification, perforation, and vision loss. In the 2022 outbreak, these ocular symptoms have been observed less often and potentially with reduced severity. Though potential underreporting exists, observational studies suggest an ocular involvement rate of approximately 1%, significantly lower than the 9–23% incidence reported in previous outbreaks in endemic regions [62,63]. Newborns have been reported to experience ocular involvement with Mpox [64]. Additionally, there are documented cases (53-year-old patient in San Francisco, CA, USA) where ocular symptoms presented independently, without concurrent skin lesions [65].

Patients presenting with ocular Mpox symptoms should be referred for ophthalmologic evaluation. A slit-lamp examination and dilated fundoscopy are valuable tools for assessing the involvement of both anterior and posterior eye structures [66].

Retinol supplementation is advised. Supportive measures such as eye lubrication and saline compresses may provide relief. In cases of co-infection, ophthalmic antibiotics or antivirals may be necessary [67]. Patients should be instructed to avoid contact lens use [68]. Topical trifluridine, under ophthalmological guidance, can be considered for conjunctivitis and is recommended for keratitis management.

3.7. FULMINANT MPOX

A severe, widespread, and destructive form of Mpox has been observed in individuals with advanced immunosuppression, such as those with CD4 counts below 100 cells/µL, high HIV viral loads, or hepatitis B co-infection. These cases show a resemblance to an AIDS-defining illness. Patients showed extensive, large necrotic skin and mucosal lesions that often merged [69]. Severe secondary bacterial infections were frequent. Complications included lung nodules, necrotic pulmonary masses, nodular hepatic lesions, respiratory insufficiency, and sepsis [70]. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) was suspected in a quarter of patients initiating or resuming antiretroviral therapy post-diagnosis [71]. Mortality was reported in 15% of patients, primarily those with CD4 counts below 200 cells/µL [70].

In moderately to severely immunocompromised patients with uncontrolled viral dissemination, optimal immune function should be prioritized. Tecovirimat should be initiated promptly, and consider adding cidofovir or brincidofovir and vaccinia immune globulin. Prolonged treatment may be necessary. Wound care is essential, and fluid management may be required. Specialist consultation should be considered as needed. Close monitoring for complications is vital [72].

3.8. COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH IMMUNE SYSTEM

Like COVID-19 infection, Mpox also creates cytokines inside the body [73]. Cytokines are Th2-mediated, and a large number of interleukins (IL-4, IL5, IL6, and IL10) are released, while TH1-mediated cytokines are released in a lower amount. Therefore, IFγ (interferon gamma), IL2, IL12, TNF-α, and IFN-α levels decreased after Mpox infection [74]. The human Mpox virus causes post-translational modification on the host cell. It downregulates those regulatory factors that increase histone expression while upregulating core histone proteins. The nucleosome formation of viruses depends on host nucleosome modification [75]. Mpox has a specific mechanism through which it defends itself via the immune reaction of the host. The intracellular protein of Mpox called Viro transducer stops apoptosis in the host cell and stops the host cell from responding against the virus [33,76]. In this way, these proteins evade the host’s immune system to allow for viral replication in the host, as shown in Figure 4. The Mpox virus uses various strategies in the host cell to escape from the host immune defense system. Innate immunity is the first line of defense and is operated by interferons (IFNs) [77]. Interferons prevent viral replication in host cells using direct or indirect pathways. There are three types of interferons: type 1, type 2, and type 3. IFNα, IFNβ, and IFNω are considered type I interferons. Type I interferons create antiviral activity in cells by activating Janus protein tyrosine kinase and signal transducers and activators of the transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway [78]. Mpox virus evades the immune response of the host in the following way: (a) An in vitro study in 2010 showed that Mpox viral protein B16 inhibits JAK-STAT induced by type I interferon [79]. (b) Another experiment performed in mice in 2004 found that homologs of D7L block interleukin (IL-18) [80]. The complement control protein (CCP) of Mpox inhibits the complement activation pathway, which is a key factor for viral defense [81]. Apart from it, many proteins of Mpox are responsible for evasion, including ankyrin-like protein, viral growth factor, IL-18 binding protein, apoptosis inhibitors, SPI-1, inhibitors of MHC class I molecules, inhibitors of IRF3 NF-kB activation, Inhibitor of IRF3 and IRF7 activation, inhibitors of MHC class II, CC, and CXC chemokine binding proteins.

4. DIAGNOSIS OF MPOX

PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is a gold standard molecular biology technique that detects the presence of Mpox viral DNA in samples such as blood, skin lesions, or respiratory secretions. PCR is a highly sensitive and specific method used for confirmatory diagnosis. Real-time PCR is the most common diagnostic procedure for the detection of Mpox. In the 2022–23 outbreak of Mpox, four novel molecular kits were used: The Novaplex MPXV Assay, the STANDARD M10 MPX/OPX, the Real Cycler MONK-UX/MONK-GX v.2, and the RealStar Orthopoxvirus PCR Kit 1.0, with an in-house PCR assay. A comparison study of diagnostic kits shows that sensitivity and specificity were 100% for the Novaplex MPXV Assay and RealStar Orthopoxvirus PCR Kit 1.0. The RealCycler MONK-UX/MONK-GX v.2 and STANDARD M10 MPX/OPX exhibited a slight decrease in the accuracy (97.3%) and diagnostic sensitivity (96.3%) [82].

The lab diagnosis of viral infections plays a crucial role in the detection of diseases and their treatment. Cell culture or tissue culture is considered to be the standard method for the isolation and cultivation of viruses, although this method is considered to be time-consuming and has a high risk of contamination [83]. The other standard methods for the detection of viruses are molecular and non-molecular techniques (immunofluorescence technique and ELISA), electron microscopy-based detection (TEM), radiation-based virus detection (X-ray diffraction technique and CT), nucleic acid amplification methods (NASBA, LAMP, RT-PCR), antigen-antibody complex-mediated detection of viruses (HAI), and CRISPR-CAS system-based detection [84]. Urine, saliva, semen, and rectal or genital samples can also be taken for investigative purposes, depending on the clinic [85].

CRISPR-based detection is also a rising diagnostic method in the field of virology. According to research conducted [86], a system was designed to detect the Mpox viral DNA using a fluorescence readout. In this study, it was shown that the G-quadruplex oligonucleotide of the target DNA, which was labeled with fluorescein (6-FAM) on the 3-prime end and black hole 1-quencher (BHQ-1) at the 5-prime end, produced a fluorescence signal when it was degraded via the CAS-12a-mediated collateral cleavage. This effect was not shown in the absence of the target DNA because CAS-12a is unable to cleave the labeled G-quadruplex oligonucleotide, and fluorescence quenching happens.

Pan-orthopoxvirus PCR/ESI-MS is another emerging method in the field of diagnostics; it can perform identification of all members of orthomyxovirus without sequencing by using the T5000 platform [87]. Here, A PCR method coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) was employed to diagnose Mpox in spiked human samples and aerosol-infected cynomolgus macaque samples.

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is another molecular diagnostic technique used in virology, offering a potential alternative to RT-PCR. This technique uses the displacement of the auto-cycling step of DNA synthesis by Bst DNA polymerase, which replicates the gene without the use of a light cycle [88].

5. TREATMENT OF MPOX

The treatment of Mpox primarily focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. The symptoms, like fever, pain, and itching, can be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Antiviral medication such as tecovirimat has been used for some patients with Mpox, particularly those with severe illness or who are at high risk of complications. Other antiviral medications, such as brincidofovir and cidofovir, may be considered in certain situations, but their use is generally limited. Vaccines are also recommended for people at high risk of exposure. To prevent infection with the Mpox virus, avoid close skin contact and contact with contaminated materials (e.g., clothing, bedding). Most people with Mpox experience mild symptoms and recover without specific treatment. Severe cases and complications are more common in individuals with weakened immune systems, children, and pregnant women.

5.1. VACCINE STRATEGIES AGAINST MPOX

Almost a thousand cases have been reported from different parts of the world since April 2022, mostly from non-endemic countries; therefore, it has become necessary to understand the possible risk factors associated with this virus. Viral inactivation is a crucial step to prevent the spreading of Mpox; among the methods of viral inactivation, heat inactivation is one of the methods of viral inactivation.

According to Batéjat Christophe et al., the Mpox virus was inoculated on two growth media named FCS and VTM and then subjected to heat inactivation at different temperatures over a period. This study showed that Mpox got inactivated in less than 5 min if heated at 70 °C and less than 15 min if heated at 60 °C, and there was no difference between clade I and clade II [89].

The United States of America currently has three vaccines against smallpox: JYNNEOSTM, also known as IMVAMUNE, ACAM2000®, and Aventis Pasteur smallpox vaccine (APSV) [90]. This vaccine JYNNEOSTM has been prepared from the modified Ortho poxvirus vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic strain and is attenuated in nature and non-replicating.

In August 2007, the FDA approved ACAM2000® for the prevention of smallpox. The ACAM2000® vaccine is also a live vaccine but shows some differences with JYNNEOS™. ACAM2000® is a replication-competent vaccinia virus, whereas JYNNEOS™ is a replication-deficient modified vaccinia Ankara virus. ACAM2000® shows some major cutaneous reactions, but JYNNEOS™ does not show cutaneous reactions. Under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), the Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine (APSV) can be used, but its effectiveness against Mpox is still unknown [90].

The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved the use of the JYNNEOS™ vaccine in 2019 to prevent smallpox and Mpox [91]. Originally, the FDA developed these vaccines for the subcutaneous route in a two-dose series (0.5 mL per dose, administered 4 weeks apart). However, due to overwhelming demand, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on 9 August 2022 for the intradermal route in a two-dose series (0.1 mL per dose, administered four weeks apart).

It was also found that full vaccination with the vaccine through subcutaneous, intradermal, and heterologous routes had an adjusted VE of 88.9% (95% CL, 56.0 to 97.2), 80.3% (95% CL, 22.9 to 95.0), and 86.9% (95% CL, 69.1 to 94.5), respectively. These vaccines are administered to persons who are either suffering from Mpox or have been previously exposed to such patients of Mpox. These vaccines (JYNNEOS™) are also offered to persons who are at high risk of getting infected by Mpox, such as gay, bisexual, MSM, transgender, non-binary, or gender non-conforming persons and HIV patients [92].

Huber et al. have shown the effectiveness of the vaccine on patients suffering from Mpox and others with MSM (men who have sex with another man), aged 18–49. A total of 309 infected patients (Mpox or MSM) were included in this study and found that the adjusted vaccine efficiency (VE) was 75.2% (95% confidence interval (CL) 61.2 to 84.2) in patients with a single dose (partial vaccination) of vaccine and 85.9% (95% CL, 73.8 to 92.4) in patients with full (two doses) vaccination [93].

Lauren Pischel quantified the vaccine efficacy of third-generation Mpox vaccines (MVA-BN, LC16m8, OrthopoxVac) in preventing infection, hospitalization, and death among the global population [94]. They compared vaccinated individuals to those unvaccinated or vaccinated with other vaccines. Additionally, they analyzed vaccine efficacy based on the number of vaccine doses (one or two) and whether the vaccine was administered as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). A comprehensive literature search yielded 11,892 initial records, with an additional 3223 identified through citation tracking. Thirty-three studies focused on third-generation Mpox vaccines, predominantly MVA-BN (32 studies). Two additional studies reanalysed existing data. The majority of these studies cantered on gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men aged 18–49, conducted between May and October 2022.

Vaccine efficacy for a single dose of MVA-BN was estimated at 76% (95% CI: 64–88%) across twelve studies. For two doses, the vaccine efficacy was calculated at 82% (95% CI: 72–92%) based on six studies. Regarding post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with MVA-BN, the vaccine efficacy against Mpox was 20% (95% CI: -24–65%) from seven studies. All vaccine efficacy estimates were derived from random-effects meta-analysis.

In terms of study quality, 18 out of 33 (55%) were rated as poor, 3 out of 33 (9%) as fair, and 12 out of 33 (36%) as good. Notably, studies included in the meta-analysis generally exhibited higher quality, with 11 out of 16 (69%) rated as good.

5.2. VARIOUS THERAPIES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF MPOX

5.2.1. TECOVIRIMAT

Tecovirimat (TPOXX, ST-246) is generally used to treat smallpox, as recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but under the Expanded Access Investigational New Drug (EA-IND) protocol, it can also be used to treat Mpox. In the United States or Canada, Tecovirimat is not approved for use against Mpox, although tecovirimat is now approved in Europe for the treatment of Mpox [95,96]. Various clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the efficacy of tecovirimat, but it is not clear.

Tecovirimat is a small molecule virus inhibitor with strong activity against Mpox and other smallpox viruses. Tecovirimat’s mechanism involves targeting the highly conserved orthopoxvirus F13L protein. This protein is essential for the creation of enveloped virions, which are necessary for viral spread. Tecovirimat functions by acting as a molecular binder, promoting the dimerization of F13L and thereby inhibiting its normal activity [97].

Early studies have indicated that tecovirimat did not significantly shorten the duration of monkeypox skin lesions [98,99]. Initial findings from the STOMP trial, which spanned multiple countries, failed to demonstrate a notable impact of tecovirimat on the healing time of skin and mucosal lesions in individuals with mild to moderate monkeypox. Notably, in the STOMP trial, a majority of participants began tecovirimat treatment more than five days after experiencing initial symptoms [100]. According to another study [101], tecovirimat, which inhibits the formation of p37 (a protein that helps in the release of enveloped virus and also enhances the virulence factor), was found to be effective in treating Mpox.

Tecovirimat is an inhibitor of the pox virus; however, Mpox also shows resistance against many drugs in cell culture, including CMX001 and ST-246 [102]. The clinical study of Mpox was done in France in 2022, where Mpox was isolated and sequenced. This study reveals that the effective concentration of tecovirimat against Mpox is in nanomolar concentrations, while cidofovir is only effective at micromolar concentrations [103]. Therefore, combination therapy may be effective for the treatment of Mpox.

The efficacy of tecovirimat has been evaluated in vitro and in vivo against a clade 2 Canadian 2022 isolate of Mpox isolated during the 2022 outbreak, and it was found that tecovirimat prevented Mpox replication in vitro with an effective concentration in the nanomolar range. The efficacy of tecovirimat was also evaluated in the CAST/EiJ mouse model with the 2022 Canadian isolate. The experiments also show that tecovirimat reduced viral titers after 1–2 weeks of infection. In 2022, tecovirimat was recommended against Mpox treatment. In vitro testing has been performed against 2022 Canadian isolates of Mpox designated Mpox/SP2833. The EC50 and EC90, for TPOXX were determined against Mpox/SP2833, a clade 1 virus in Vero E6 cells is 0.008 ± 0.0014 (EC50 value (μM) ± SE) and 0.0145 ± 0.0138 (EC90 value (μM) ± SE) [104].

In a recent study published in the Lancet journal in 2025, the author conducted an in vitro analysis comparing the susceptibility of clades 1b and 2b to tecovirimat. The clade 1b isolate was obtained in Sweden in August 2024 from a traveler returning from Africa. For comparison, the clade 2b virus was isolated in France in June 2022 from a patient at the Institut Pasteur Medical Center. Additionally, ancestral clades 1a and 2a were included as controls, utilizing U2OS cells, known for their high sensitivity to Mpox virus infection, as target cells. The findings demonstrated that tecovirimat effectively suppressed all four viral strains, exhibiting comparable half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) ranging from 15.3 nM to 25.8 Nm [105].

5.2.2. CIDOFOVIR AND BRINCIDOFOVIR

Brincidofovir and cidofovir are also being used as DNA polymerase inhibitors for Mpox treatment, despite not being approved by the FDA. In vitro and in vivo studies reported that both cidofovir and brincidofovir can stop the replication of Mpox [106]. When Brin cidofovir derivative (CMX001) is given to the host, the lipid part of the drug breaks down and releases cidofovir, which forms cidofovir-diphosphate after phosphorylation, which inhibits DNA polymerase [107,108].

In a 2020 study, another new drug was reported, which is Nioch-14, having antiviral activity against Mpox [106].

5.2.3. RESVERATROL

A recent study indicated that resveratrol plays an important role in Mpox treatment. Resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxystilbene) is a natural polyphenol found in grapes, peanuts, pines, and berries [109,110]. It is also available in red and white wines, but a higher concentration is found in red wine. The maximum amount of resveratrol is found in Polygonum cuspidatum (524 μg/g). It is also known as Japanese knotweed, which has been extensively used for inflammatory treatments in 2012–13. Resveratrol is found in cis and trans forms, but the trans form is highly effective in anti-inflammatory activity. The antiviral effects of resveratrol have been explored in several viruses, including the Mpox virus, the influenza A virus [111] Epstein–Barr virus [112], Herpes simplex virus [113], HIV [114], and hepatitis C virus [115].

Resveratrol inhibits the replication of many viruses [111,115,116,117,118,119,120]. The antiviral mechanisms of resveratrol against various types of viruses are different. Resveratrol reduced the virus yield by more than 120-fold at a concentration of 50 mM. The effect of resveratrol against Mpox has also been examined using HeLa cells. HeLa cells were infected with two strains of Mpox virus, Mpox-WA and Mpox-ROC, and it was found that resveratrol at 50 mM concentration reduced the yield of Mpox-WA and Mpox-ROC Clades by 195- and 38-fold, respectively [121].

Apart from these potential therapies, some other alternative treatments such as TOP1 inhibitor, chlorhexidine, and cysteine proteinase inhibitors are being explored, but more investigation is required for the effective treatment of these compounds.

5.2.4. PLANT METABOLITE AS A THERAPEUTIC DRUG

A recent study was conducted in 2023, in which the anti-monkeypox capability was evaluated in 56 plant products. Among these metabolites, curcumin showed the strongest binding affinity with a value of −37.43 kcal/mol, followed by gedunin (−34.89 kcal/mol), piperine (−34.58 kcal/mol), and coumadin (−34.14 kcal/mol) [122]. The study that occurred in 2022 shows various natural compounds obtained from Plantago lanceolate targeting on profilin-like protein A42R of Mpox virus [123]. The A42R protein of Mpox has an amino acid sequence similarity with profilin proteins of eukaryotic cells [124]. Profilin family proteins are actin-binding proteins responsible for F-actin assembly in the actin filament and also participate in the regulation of F-actin [125]. Silico-based screening identified various important compounds, such as luteolin 7,30-diglucuronide, luteolin 7-glucuronide-30-glucoside, plantagoside, narcissoside, and others [123]. The molecular dynamics simulation and post-simulation analysis revealed that plantagoside and narcissoside were found to be more stable products that were able to bind with the binding pocket of the viral protein of the Mpox virus due to hydrophobic and hydrogen interactions.

6. CONCLUSIONS

Mpox, while historically less prevalent than other orthopoxviruses, has demonstrated a significant emergence for globally, highlighting the importance of robust surveillance and preparedness. Its complications, while often self-limiting, can be severe, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and children. Transmission, primarily through close contact, necessitates stringent public health measures to curtail outbreaks. Accurate and timely diagnosis, facilitated by PCR testing, is crucial for effective management and containment. While specific antiviral treatments are available, their accessibility and widespread use remain limited, emphasizing the need for further research and development. Effective public health strategies, including vaccination and education, are essential in mitigating the impact of Mpox and preventing future pandemics. Continued research into the virus’s evolving epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and optimal treatment strategies is imperative to safeguard global health.

The 2019 coronavirus pandemic demonstrated that disease outbreaks extend beyond physical illness, significantly affecting mental well-being. Individuals experienced heightened fear, including anxiety about potential loss and depression linked to isolation. Healthcare workers facing direct exposure reported particularly elevated levels of fear. Parallels can be drawn with the Mpox outbreak, which has also been associated with notable economic and behavioral shifts, manifesting in increased anger, frustration, depression, and anxiety.

The health care provider also has very little knowledge regarding the treatment of Mpox, so proper guidance and care of Mpox-affected people should be done for the management of mental health issues in COVID-19-affected people, WHO issued advisories that may be implemented in Mpox cases.

The important suggestions to control mental disorders during the monkeypox outbreak are as follows: (a) Always study and gain knowledge from an authorized source, such as WHO. (b) Do not come under the influence of people who are already suffering from any mental disorder because of an outbreak. (c) Avoid drinking alcohol or smoking during an outbreak because it will only ruin your health condition. (d) Hand hygiene practices should be followed regularly. (e) Eat a well-balanced diet, and try to avoid sitting alone. Even when you are alone in the house, try to chat with your friends or family members via social media. (f) Exercise daily.

The outbreaks in 2022 across the globe have emphasized the significance of continuous and focused intensive care, along with the development of novel drugs.

The limited smallpox vaccine administration and decreasing immunity in the population can enhance virus spreading globally. Patients of Mpox have different kinds of complications, such as bacterial infection of the skin, skin scarring, permanent corneal scarring, pneumonia, dehydration, sepsis, and encephalitis. It is imperative to provide comprehensive care for patients, including education, nutritional support, hydration, and protection of sensitive organs such as the eyes and genitals. Therefore, it is important for the medical professional team, including clinicians, health experts, and nurses, to immediately identify infection in humans and animals, use protective measures, and initiate public health reporting to prevent an outbreak.
Mpox and Lessons Learned in the Light of the Recent Outbreak: A Narrative Review

Abstract

According to the WHO, more than 90,000 cases of mpox have been reported since the 2022 worldwide outbreak, which resulted in 167 deaths, while a new outbreak in Africa since 2023 has resulted in over 18,000 cases and 617 deaths. Mpox is a zoonosis caused by the monkeypox virus, a double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the Orthopoxvirus genus, which causes smallpox-like illness. Until 2022, cases were predominately located in West and Central Africa, with only sporadic cases and outbreaks reported in other parts of the world. During the 2022 outbreak, the primary mode of transmission was sexual contact among men who have sex with men. The changing epidemiology of mpox resulted in new disease phenotypes and populations at risk, disproportionally affecting people who live with HIV. Commonly presenting as a mild, self-limiting illness, mpox can cause severe and protracted disease in people with HIV with a CD4 count < 200 cell/mm3. The global emergence of mpox that followed and intersected with COVID-19 mobilized the scientific community and healthcare stakeholders to provide accurate diagnostics, preventive vaccines and treatment to those most affected. Despite existing gaps, this rapid response helped to contain the outbreak, but challenges remain as new variants emerge. Preparedness and readiness to respond to the next outbreak is crucial in order to minimize the impact to the most vulnerable.

1. INTRODUCTION

The worldwide outbreak of mpox (previously known as monkeypox) in 2022 brought this previously neglected disease into the spotlight [1]. Endemic in West and Central Africa for decades, mpox emerged, for reasons not yet quite understood, in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it also intercepted with the HIV epidemic, disproportionately affecting people living with HIV (PLWH) and men who have sex with men (MSM) [2]. The reflexes of the scientific community and health policymakers were immediate as they swiftly mobilized resources and implemented measures to address the situation [3]. The preceding COVID-19 pandemic had laid the groundwork for the rapid recognition and surveillance of the mpox epidemic as well as vaccine production and delivery, public communication and the implementation of preventive strategies to contain the disease. The already-established networks of sexual health/HIV services and community stakeholders took on the task of informing the populations most at risk and implementing prevention, testing and treatment protocols [4,5,6]. This review outlines the origins and virology of the monkeypox virus (MPXV) as well as its clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment. It also lays out the available preventive measures, with a focus on vaccination, and discusses the preparedness of global and community leaders to effectively respond to this outbreak as the world anticipates the next one.

2. TAXONOMY AND VIROLOGY

MPXV is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the Poxviridae family of the genus Orthopoxvirus and is closely related to vaccinia virus, the cause of smallpox [7]. The name of the virus originates from its discovery in 1958 in Copenhagen in laboratory cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) presenting smallpox-like disease [8]. Although the primary host of the virus is still elusive, various African rodents have been reported to be potential reservoirs, whereas apes and monkeys are considered to be intermediate hosts [9,10]. After the 2022 outbreak, a nomenclature change was suggested to destigmatize the disease, resulting in the adoption of the name mpox for the disease caused by MPXV by the World Health Organization (WHO). A consensus was also reached to rename the two viral clades, previously known as Congo Basin and West African, to Clades I and II, respectively. Furthermore, two subclades of Clade II were recognized, with Clade IIb referring to the virus that caused the 2022 outbreak [10,11,12]. More recently, an offset of Clade I was identified, named Clade Ib, that caused an outbreak with sustained human-to-human transmission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) [13].

Poxviruses are characterized by their cytoplasmatic replication, in contrast to other DNA viruses whose reproduction takes place inside the cell nucleus [14]. Moreover, they are among the largest viruses, with MPXV reaching a length of 220–450 nm and having a brick-like shape [15]. The core of the mature virion contains 197 kb long linear dsDNA and core fibrils, and it is surrounded by the core membrane and a palisade layer that gives the core its characteristic biconcave shape. Two lateral bodies are located between the core and the outer membrane, while spontaneously released virions are also surrounded by a lipoprotein envelope (Figure 1) [15,16,17]. Due to their large size, poxviruses are easily detected by host immune defenses and have a more prolonged replication cycle in comparison with smaller viruses. Therefore, they employ elaborate strategies to survive in the host cell, producing molecules that disrupt the host’s defenses, both within the cell and extracellularly [18,19]. Intracellular virulence factors include virotransducer and virostealth proteins, which act by dampening the cell’s response to infection and by reducing the detection of the infected cell by the immune system, respectively [20,21]. On the other hand, viromimic proteins act in the extracellular space and include viroreceptors and virokines. Viroreceptors bind and virokines mimic chemokines and cytokines secreted by the host, consequently evading their antiviral action and promoting viral survival and replication [19,22]. Despite the abundance of these virulence factors in all poxviruses, each virus exhibits its own set of immune-evasion tactics, resulting in pathogenic differences, even within the same species [23]. For example, Clade I MPXV expresses a complement-binding protein that interferes with complement activation, which is absent from Clade II MPXV [23,24]. This may partly explain the higher fatality rate of mpox in Central Africa (10–17%), where Clade I is prevalent, and the relatively more benign disease during the 2022 epidemic caused by the Clade IIb variant [25,26]. Moreover, facilitated human-to-human transmission of both the Clade IIb and Ib MPXV has been proposed to result from noncanonical viral evolution driven by the accumulation of characteristic mutations associated with the action of the apolipoprotein B messenger RNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide 3 (APOBEC3) [13,27]. APOBEC3 enzymes belong to the cytidine deaminase family (they deaminate cytosine to uracil), introduce G → A mutations to the complementary DNA and demonstrate antiviral properties [28]. Experimentally, human APOBEC3F has been found to cause hypermutations in the MPXV genome, which may have driven the viral evolution that has been seen to contribute to the recent epidemics [27,29,30].

3. ORIGIN AND EPIDEMIOLOGY

3.1. WEST AND CENTRAL AFRICA

After its first appearance in 1958, MPXV outbreaks in imported captive primates were recorded in the US and the Netherlands for the next 10 years, yet no human case was recorded [31]. In 1970, the first case of mpox in humans was reported in a 9-month-old child from the DRC, who presented with smallpox-like disease [32,33]. Since then, several West and Central African countries have reported sporadic cases and self-contained outbreaks related to animal contact, with limited human-to-human transmission. In the period 1996–1996, the DRC recorded a more serious outbreak with more sustained human-to-human transmission [34]. As the universal variola vaccination, which was 85% effective in preventing mpox, was halted after the success of the Smallpox Eradication Programme in 1980, population immunity gradually waned [35]. The first outbreak outside Africa was recorded in the USA in 2003 and originated from prairie dogs, which in turn had been infected by imported rodents from Ghana. During this outbreak, MPXV Clade II caused 72 confirmed or suspected cases, with no proven human-to-human transmission or fatalities being reported [36,37].

In the meantime, mpox remained endemic in the DRC, with cases also recorded in 9 other countries in West and Central Africa [38]. Surveillance of the disease showed a steadily increased incidence between 1980 and 2005 [39], continuing through 2013 [30]. In early 2022, a systematic review showed that published cases almost doubled between 2000 and 2009 and 2009 and 2019, with the majority of cases reportedly being caused by Clade I [40]. In 2017, after 40 years of no reported cases, Nigeria reported its first outbreak of Clade II mpox, which was the source of the first exported human cases outside Africa that were recorded in the United Kingdom, Israel and Singapore [41]. This outbreak was characterized by sustained human-to-human transmission, while the epidemiological data suggested sexual contact to be among the possible modes of transmission [42]. This outbreak was caused by the Clade IIb virus that eventually gave rise to the MPXV lineage B.1, the cause of the 2022 global outbreak [43].

3.2. 2022 GLOBAL OUTBREAK

In early May 2022, the WHO reported the first cases of mpox in the United Kingdom that were not related to travel to endemic countries, raising concern for community spread, and by mid-May 2022, cases were reported in 12 countries [44]. Gradually, more countries started to report cases in all six WHO regions. On 23 July 2022, the WHO Director-General declared this outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [45]. As of 7 February 2024, nearly 92,000 cases of mpox have been recorded in more than 100 countries not endemic for MPXV, resulting in 156 deaths [46]. The worldwide epidemic disproportionately affected MSM, while intimate sexual contact was the main route of transmission [47]. The epidemic reached its peak in August 2022 and, despite cases being on the decline since then, low levels of transmission are still reported [48]. This outbreak, caused by a new MPXV lineage, marked a significant change in mpox epidemiology, risk factors and clinical presentation and raised awareness of a previously neglected disease. The PHEIC was declared to be over in May 2023 after there had been a sustained decline in global cases [49].

3.3. 2023–2024 OUTBREAK

As early as September 2023, an epidemic of a new variant of Clade I MPXV, called Clade 1b, began in Central Africa [50]. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (ACDC) reported an increase of approximately 160% from the previous year [51]. During 2024, over 21,000 mpox cases due to MPXV Clade I and Clade II have been reported from 13 African Union Member States, including over 3000 confirmed cases, in Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo (hereafter referred to as Congo), Côte d’Ivoire, DRC, Ghana, Liberia, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa and Uganda [52]. In DRC, most cases and deaths reported were among those < 15 years of age, representing 66% of the total cases and 82% of the total deaths. Males accounted for 73% of the cases in DRC. In Congo, based on information provided by the Africa CDC, most confirmed cases (56%) were children < 15 years of age and 58% were male; similarly, in the Central African Republic, 43% of the confirmed cases were < 15 years of age and 62% were male [53].

As of August 2024, 18,737 suspected cases and 617 deaths (case fatality rate: 2.57%) have been reported in 13 African countries, nearly all in the DRC [52]. This rate is significantly higher than the previously reported fatality rate of less than 0.1% recorded during the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak [47]. However, the size of these outbreaks could be much larger than reported due to under-ascertainment and under-reporting in those areas [54]. Consequently, the true number of infections is likely to be higher than the reported figures, while the case fatality rate may have been overestimated. Moreover, it is reasonable to assume that community transmission is occurring in several African countries, considering the wide geographic distribution of cases and the diverse age groups involved.

As a result, on 14 August 2024, the World Health Organization declared the epidemic to be a second Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [50]. On 15 August 2024, Sweden reported the first imported case of mpox due to MPXV Clade Ib in EU/EEA countries [55]. Hence, on 16 August, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) adjusted the risk level of Clade I for the European population, raising it from “very low” to “low” in response to the anticipated rise in imported cases across the region. Nonetheless, the ECDC noted that the risk depended on type of contact and the population immunity setting. Despite this, the agency stressed that the probability of the ongoing transmission of the virus strain within Europe remained minimal [56].

4. RISK FACTORS

Understanding the risk factors associated with mpox transmission and spread is important to implement effective prevention and infection control strategies. Zoonotic transmission occurs through direct contact with bodily fluids, the mucosal and cutaneous lesions of infected animals such as rodents and primates or the consumption of undercooked meat from infected animals [57]. This is a significant risk factor, particularly in regions where interactions between humans and wildlife is common, including in rural areas with dense forests or regions with tropical rainforests such as Central and West Africa [57]. Despite human-to-animal transmission being uncommon, a few cases of human-to-dog transmission have been reported [58,59]. Although zoonotic transmission is the primary mode of infection, human-to-human transmission may prevail during outbreaks, involving the inhalation of respiratory droplets or direct contact with the lesions or bodily fluids of a patient [57]. Factors such as overcrowding, poor sanitation and inadequate healthcare infrastructure may facilitate the spread of mpox [57,60]. Nosocomial outbreaks and the transmission of MPXV during laboratory research as well as vertical transmission through the placenta have also been reported [61,62]. Socioeconomic disparities, including communities with limited access to healthcare, education and resources and cultural practices, including the hunting, handling or consumption of wildlife, are additional risk factors for mpox [57,60].

Primary zoonotic mpox is more common in men, as they are more likely to be hunters, and in younger individuals, as they are more likely to eat undercooked infected animals [63]. In the 2022 outbreak, however, among the cases with known data on sexual behavior, 85.5% identified as MSM; among the cases who reported a type of transmission, 83.5% reported a sexual encounter [48]. Sexual transmission has been suggested because virus DNA has been detected in seminal fluid [64]. The R(t) (reproduction number) of mpox during the current outbreak in Italy was 2.43 among MSM, showing that the virus has the potential to cause epidemics in this population [65]. People unvaccinated against smallpox are at an increased risk of infection, while pediatric patients or young and immunocompromised adults such as PLWH are at a higher risk of severe disease [66,67].

MPOX IN PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of HIV infection among patients diagnosed with mpox was 41% [68]. More specifically, studies from Europe and North America reported high prevalences of HIV co-infection of about 41% and 52%, respectively, while studies from Nigeria in Africa reported a relatively low prevalence of 21% [68]. During the 2017/2018 Nigerian mpox outbreak, 22.5% of hospitalized patients with mpox were PLWH. In the 2022 global mpox outbreak, 52% of the confirmed mpox cases were PLWH, predominantly sexual and gender minority groups, indicating that sexual activity was underestimated as a major risk of transmission before the 2022 outbreak [69]. Living with HIV, receiving pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or reporting ≥ 20 sexual partners in the past 12 months as well as sex in sex venues/parties in the past 2 months were found to be independent risk factors for mpox diagnosis [70]. It has been reported that PLWH with mpox have a higher frequency of perioral lesions and pharyngitis as well as a higher number of sexually transmitted infections [67,71].

Individuals with advanced or uncontrolled HIV infection are at a higher risk of severe mpox [66,72,73]. The combination of HIV-induced immunosuppression and the virulence of the monkeypox virus may result in increased viral replication, prolonged disease and a higher risk of complications [73]. Severe complications and systemic manifestations were more common in people with a CD4 cell count < 100 cells/μL than in those with > 300 cells/μL, while death was observed in people with CD4 counts of < 200 cells/μL and with a high HIV viral load [2]. Mpox severity was also related to poor HIV continuum of care outcomes and low CD4+ cell counts, while increased mortality was reported in PLWH with CD4+ counts < 50 cells/μL [74]. In one study, the case fatality rates of mpox disease were 9.4% and 20.8% overall and in HIV-positive cases, respectively, demonstrating that HIV infection is associated with a higher risk of contracting and dying from mpox [67]. In particular, PLWH with a CD4 T cell count < 50 cells/μL face a high risk of mortality due to mpox [72]. Furthermore, a cohort of PLWH and mpox, which predominantly included individuals with advanced or uncontrolled HIV infection, showed that this population was significantly more likely to experience severe mpox manifestations and prolonged disease compared with those without HIV [69]. On the contrary, other studies showed that there was no significant difference in disease severity and presentation between groups with and without HIV, especially for those with well-controlled HIV infection, suggesting that HIV status itself may not be a risk factor for mpox severity, but an indicator for increased sexual risk behaviors and, therefore, mpox transmission [75,76]. Healthcare providers and public health stakeholders should address the vulnerabilities of PLWH and prioritize early detection, prompt treatment initiation and comprehensive care in order to improve the outcomes of mpox disease in this population.

5. CLINICAL PRESENTATION

The incubation period of mpox exhibits great variability depending on the outbreak and the presumed mode of exposure [77]. It is estimated that the average duration between infection and symptom onset ranges from 5 to 13 days [8,78,79]. The clinical presentation of mpox includes both a systemic illness and system-specific symptoms (Figure 2) [58]. Studies of more recent outbreaks reveal a greater variability in the relationship between systemic disease and organ-specific symptoms [77,80]. In this review, we delineated the most common clinical presentations observed in the 2022 outbreak, categorized by organ system and with respect to the natural course of the disease.

Systemic symptoms of mpox correspond with the active replication of the virus and may predate or follow the appearance of the characteristic rash [78,81]. These symptoms include, but are not limited to, fever, headache, myalgia, fatigue and lymphadenopathy, lasting for one to five days [77,78]. During the 2022 outbreak, the clinical presentation was frequently associated with rash development in the absence of systemic illness, while lymphadenopathy was usually related to the appearance of the skin rash [77]. The characteristic rash is typically well circumscribed and follows a predictable evolution timeline [77,82,83,84]. Lesions described in the 2022 outbreak typically evolved in an asynchronous manner over 7 to 14 days, starting as macules of 2 to 5 mm on an edematous background and then evolving to papules, vesicles and umbilicated pustules before crusting and healing with complete re-epithelialization (Figure 3) [78,82]. Pruritus is commonly associated with the crusting period. Rarely, lesions coalesce into plaques or ulcerate and become necrotic [78,82]. The number of lesions can vary from 1 to 20 on average, with some cases presenting up to 100 lesions [78,82].

In the recent outbreak, these lesions were more often located in the perioral, genital and perianal area, with fewer lesions appearing on the trunk or extremities, suggesting a possible correlation between sites of inoculation and lesion appearance [78,82,85]. Perioral and oral lesions are usually circular and white, commonly ulcerative in nature and with a central depression [78,82,85,86]. They may appear on the tongue, lip mucosa, tonsils or pharynx and are associated with pain and dysphagia [78,82,85,86]. Genital lesions are usually solitary, located on the prepuce or the glans of the penis in males and on the labia in females and are almost universally associated with severe pain and edema [64,78,82,85,87]. Typically, perianal and anal lesions mimic proctitis, causing painful bowel movements; they are associated with discharge and bleeding and, in rare cases, with bowel perforation [64,78,82]. Their morphology is more ambiguous, spanning from vesicles to pustules to ulcers, often resembling herpes, syphilis, lymphogranuloma venereum or other pathologies [64,78,82].

The most common ocular manifestations of mpox include conjunctivitis, blepharitis, keratitis and secondary cellulitis, leading, in some cases, to loss of vision [88,89]. The involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) in the form of encephalitis and encephalomyelitis have been described, although it has not been elucidated if these manifestations represent a consequence of mpox infection or a secondary immune-mediated phenomenon [2,90,91]. Other systems can also be affected, causing severe complications such as sepsis, necrotizing lymphadenopathy, bronchopneumonia, myocarditis, abscess formation and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [64,82,92,93,94]. In a nationwide UK cohort, severe pain and secondary bacterial infection were the most common complications in hospitalized patients with mpox [95].

6. DIAGNOSIS

Mpox should be suspected in all patients with consistent clinical, laboratory and epidemiological findings [96]. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all patients presenting with a morphologically suspicious rash, especially if consistent symptoms from other systems are present [96,97]. A history of contact with suspected or confirmed cases or recent travel to areas where mpox is endemic or where outbreaks have been reported should be taken into account [96,97].

In terms of laboratory testing, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed on material collected from typical lesions is considered to be the gold standard for mpox diagnosis. In the setting of numerous lesions, the sampling of multiple sites may increase the diagnostic accuracy [97,98]. A PCR using throat swabs and blood adds little to the diagnosis in a clinical setting [97,98]. Antibody testing for mpox may be performed when a PCR is not readily available, with a relatively narrow seroconversion window after the appearance of symptoms [99]. Despite its value in research, electron microscopy is not considered feasible for routine diagnosis [100,101]. Histopathological findings in tissues presenting typical lesions are non-specific and have little value in clinical practice [101]. A high index of suspicion and the availability of PCR testing are the cornerstones for an accurate and timely diagnosis of mpox.

Mpox needs to be differentiated from other exanthematous diseases such as chickenpox, measles, scabies, hand–mouth–foot disease, genital herpes, syphilis and other sexually transmissible infections (STIs) [102,103]. Lymphadenopathy is common in mpox, but mostly absent in chickenpox. Herpes often causes oral or anogenital polycyclic lesions, usually in people with similar previous episodes. When genital ulcers or proctitis are present, the recommended method for accurate diagnosis is PCR testing [104]. Furthermore, when sexual transmission is suspected, testing for other STIs should also be conducted [105].

7. TREATMENT

The management of mpox infection should take into account the disease severity, clinical manifestations and involvement of specific anatomic sites as well as the immunological status of the patient, the risk of progression to severe disease and the development of complications [47,106,107]. In the majority of immunocompetent patients, mpox presents as a mild clinical syndrome that can be optimally managed by supportive measures and minimal, if any, medical intervention [106]. Supportive measures should aim to optimize nutrition and hydration, pain management and the prevention of possible complications [107]. Hospitalization is usually indicated for patients experiencing severe infection who are at risk of malnourishment or dehydration due to lesions located at the level of the rectum or the oropharynx and for patients who develop complications or need intensive pain management [47].

Antiviral therapy is not indicated for all patients, but it is recommended for those with severe disease presenting with numerous confluent lesions, neurological manifestations and respiratory or multisystemic involvement [108]. Patients with a documented history of autoinflammatory and/or exfoliative skin disorders and ocular manifestations as well as patients with multimorbidity are also candidates for antiviral therapy. An immunocompromised status such as advanced HIV infection, hematological malignancy, bone marrow or solid organ transplantation, chemotherapy or radiation as well as documented autoimmune disease are all strong indicators for antiviral treatment [47,107,108]. Very young (<8 years old) and very old individuals as well as pregnant and breastfeeding people can also benefit from antiviral therapy [109,110,111]. The timing of antiviral therapy initiation is based on limited clinical data; however, early treatment initiation after the appearance of symptoms is thought to be associated with a more rapid clinical response and favorable clinical outcomes [112].

The mainstay of antiviral therapy for mpox is tecovirimat, an agent with a favorable safety profile and mild side effects whose efficacy is being increasingly supported by observational data, especially for patients with severe disease and when started early in the course of disease [77,113,114,115]. Evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is currently lacking; however, several RCTs are now ongoing. The preliminary results from PALM 007 (NCT05559099) suggest that tecovirimat is safe, but it did not improve Clade I mpox outcomes [116]. Whether or not this is a clade-specific outcome remains to be investigated. Tecovirimat is an inhibitor of the Orthopoxvirus VP37 envelope-wrapping protein, effectively limiting the formation of the extracellular virus particle, necessary for viral dissemination within the host [117,118]. A low barrier to the virus developing resistance to tecovirimat should be considered before treatment initiation and its overuse, especially in mild cases, should be avoided [47,107,119,120,121]. It is available in oral and intravenous formulations. Orally, the administered dose is 600 mg q12hr for those < 120 kg and q8hr for those > 120 kg. The intravenous form is administered at 200 mg q12hr for those < 120 kg and at 300 mg for those > 120 kg [119,120,121]. A switch from intravenous to oral treatment should be considered for patients who are able to take oral medication. Treatment typically lasts 14 days but, in selected cases, the treatment duration can be extended. Possible drug interactions with immunosuppressive agents and antiretroviral treatment should be considered before treatment initiation [119,120,121].

When tecovirimat is not available, cidofovir and brincidofovir represent alternative regimens that have been used in clinical practice with less favorable side-effect profiles and very limited data concerning efficacy [122,123,124,125,126,127]. In patients with ocular mpox, tecovirimat is strongly advised with the addition of trifluridine in the form of eye drops or ointment applied q4hr for 7 to 10 days [128]. Skin lesions that fail to heal, extend despite treatment or show changes in terms of the morphology, associated erythema or other signs of inflammation must be evaluated for bacterial superinfection and appropriate antibiotic treatment initiated [129].

8. PREVENTION

8.1. CONTACT PRECAUTIONS

The implementation of effective infection control measures such as contact precautions is essential for the prevention of mpox transmission and spread within healthcare and community settings [60]. However, increased community awareness and wider surveillance of cases through publicity and education about the risk factors, prevention and treatment of mpox are crucial to control and eliminate infection as well as to minimize stigmatization [60]. In addition, the WHO and CDC guidelines highlight the importance of early detection, the isolation of cases, the appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and communication with healthcare workers and the public [130,131]. According to these guidelines, the contact precautions for mpox include the isolation of suspected or confirmed cases, the use of PPE and the implementation of strict hand-hygiene practices to minimize the risk of transmission [130]. More specifically, contact and droplet precautions should be implemented for any suspected or confirmed patient with mpox as well as airborne precautions if aerosol-generating procedures are performed [130]. Furthermore, surfaces frequently used by the patient or where patient-care activities occur as well as patient-care equipment should be cleaned and disinfected, while fabric items such as linens, hospital gowns, towels and clothes should be carefully handled and collected [130]. Also, all bodily fluids and solid waste of patients with mpox should be treated as infectious waste [130]. All patients with mpox should be advised to abstain from sex until all skin lesions have crusted, the scabs have fallen off and a fresh layer of skin has formed underneath. Condoms should be consistently used during sexual activity (receptive and insertive oral, anal or vaginal) for 12 weeks after recovery [130]. Isolation of the suspected or confirmed mpox cases, ideally in a room with negative pressure and social distancing, is needed to prevent transmission [60]. Additionally, it is important to avoid any direct contact with animals such as rodents and primates (as they can be potential virus reservoirs) as well as exposure to blood and inadequately cooked meat [60]. The quarantine of imported animals for at least 6 weeks should be implemented and laboratory research with live MPXV should be strictly regulated to minimize spill-over events [60].

8.2. VACCINATION

Vaccination remains one of the primary strategies for the prevention and control of mpox outbreaks [82]. Vaccinia-poxvirus-based vaccines were used throughout the 20th century to eradicate human smallpox epidemics. These vaccines provide cross-protective immunity against mpox, providing a protection of about 85%. This has led to the incorporation of vaccinia-virus-based vaccines in the control efforts for outbreaks [106]. Vaccine-induced immunity lasts for a long period of time as people vaccinated against smallpox > 25 years ago are still protected against mpox, while the incidence of mpox infections significantly increased 40 years after the discontinuation of smallpox vaccination campaigns [132]. ACAM2000 is a second-generation live-attenuated vaccinia-based vaccine that was approved by the FDA in August 2007 for individuals > 18 years of age to replace the older vaccinia-virus-based vaccines and it was used for mpox prevention [133]. This vaccine is indicated for immunocompetent people and non-pregnant or non-breastfeeding people who are at a high risk of exposure [133]. It is administered once by the percutaneous route (scarification) using a bifurcated needle; a pustular-like skin reaction occurs at the injection site, forming a scab after 2–3 weeks [133]. The ACAM2000 vaccine is effective against mpox infection; however, it can cause severe adverse effects such as myopericarditis, progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, post-vaccination encephalitis and severe fetal smallpox through vertical transmission [106,134].

A modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine, also known as Jynneos in the USA, Imvamune in Canada or Imvanex in Europe, originated from the genetic modification of the vaccinia Ankara–Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN strain) virus grown in chicken embryo fibroblasts [135]. It is a third-generation, live-attenuated, non-replicating viral vector vaccine that was approved by the FDA in September 2019 and is indicated for the prevention of human smallpox and mpox in people over 18 years of age at a high risk of these infections. It is subcutaneously or intradermally administered in two doses at least 28 days apart [135]. High immunogenicity and an excellent safety profile have been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials [136,137]. Since the 2022 outbreak, data on the effectiveness of a single-dose MVA-BN show a moderate effect in preventing mpox infection [138]. Another third-generation live-attenuated replicating vaccine is LC16m8, which was derived from the Lister (Elstree) strain of vaccinia and was licensed in Japan for immunization against smallpox and mpox [139,140]. Studies have shown that LC16m8 is highly immunogenic against mpox, with a favorable safety profile [139,140].

According to the WHO recommendations for vaccination strategies against MPXV infections, a primary preventive pre-exposure vaccination with third-generation non-replicating vaccines is only recommended for individuals at a high risk of exposure such as gay, bisexual or other MSM with multiple sexual partners as well as sex workers, healthcare workers at a high risk of exposure, laboratory personnel working directly with any poxviruses and personnel designated by the health authorities who are directly involved in the treatment of and contact with possible mpox cases [141]. Mass vaccination is not currently required nor recommended for mpox [141]. Post-exposure preventive vaccination with a third-generation vaccine is recommended in the first 3–4 days of exposure and up to 14 days for the close contacts of infected people with a high risk of exposure, but if administered between days 4 to 14 post-exposure, the vaccine only minimizes the symptoms and does not prevent infection [141]. It is worth noting that in immunocompetent individuals, the ACAM2000 vaccine can be also administered for post-exposure prevention [141]. Thus, vaccination against mpox may be an effective measure for the prevention or attenuation of the disease, controlling the epidemics of mpox along with other preventive measures such as contact precautions.

9. REINFECTION AND POST-VACCINATION INFECTION

Although the duration of immunity provided by vaccination or a past infection is under investigation, an increasing number of case reports of possible mpox reinfections have been published since January 2023 [142,143]. For some of the possible reinfection cases, there is still a debate as to whether they are relapses of previous infections or not because confirmation from phylogenetic sequencing has not been possible. Nevertheless, there is at least one case of reinfection that has been confirmed by whole-genome sequencing [144]. The epidemiologic characteristics and risk factors for reinfection and post-vaccination infection show consistency with those described in the literature for primary mpox infections in the 2022 epidemic. Sexually active MSM (either PLWH or on PrEP) reporting multiple sexual partners and condomless sexual intercourse compose the majority of these cases [145,146]. Of note, a significant proportion of the individuals diagnosed with reinfection or post-vaccination mpox infection had a concomitant STI.

Clinical manifestations of repeated or post-vaccination infections seem to differ from those reported in the 2022 outbreak in terms of the extent and severity. To date, no deaths have been reported among these cases, while the number of individuals who required hospitalization is limited [145,147,148]. It is worth mentioning that more than 10% of the individuals diagnosed during the 2022 epidemic required hospitalization [47,64,143]. In a global case series of individuals with repeated mpox infection (mostly PLWH or on PrEP), significantly fewer lesions were observed during reinfection compared with the initial infection and the time required for the resolution of symptoms was shorter. Moreover, the extent of body involvement, the number of mucosal areas affected and analgesia requirement were lower during reinfection and none of the cases required hospitalization [145]. When compared with repeat infections, individuals with infection after vaccination showed a less extensive involvement of extragenital areas and less analgesia requirement.

In conclusion, the ever-increasing number of reinfection and breakthrough mpox cases underscores the importance of including mpox in the differential diagnosis of individuals with presumed immunity through recent infection or vaccination presenting with symptoms compatible with mpox.

10. GLOBAL AND COMMUNITY RESPONSES

After the recognition of the first mpox cases in May 2022 in several non-endemic countries and the widespread epidemic that followed, a PHEIC was rapidly declared on 23 July 2022 [45]. To contain the spread of the disease, a rapid global response was warranted, capitalizing on the knowledge gained during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The significance of international collaboration in terms of surveillance and data-sharing was immediately acknowledged. From the very beginning of the epidemic, information was collected and communicated in real time by the appropriate authorities/organizations, both at national and international levels. This led to the early identification of MSM as the population most affected as well as the risk factors associated with this epidemic. As a result, sexual health clinics were on the frontline of this epidemic. The primary goal was the early detection of mpox cases so that timely isolation and contact tracing could take place. These interventions were necessary to reduce the spread of the virus.

Due to the possible stigmatizing features of the disease and given the lessons learned from the HIV epidemic, community involvement was deemed essential to cultivate trust, establish routes of communication and reach marginalized groups [149,150]. Several successful examples of community-led initiatives have been reported. Early in the mpox outbreak in 2022, HIV/AIDS organizations in Germany and transgender women’s groups in Peru managed to reduce spread by raising awareness in the LGBTQI+ community, underlying the importance of community involvement [150]. Community engagement proved to be important in reducing stress and mpox-related stigma as well as distinguishing between real information and misinformation and conspiracy theories across social networks during the epidemic [59,151]. Moreover, at the beginning of this outbreak, a lack of trust in health systems among a significant proportion of the public after the experience of SARS-CoV-2 was still fresh. The cooperation of the state with community organizations managed to shift the sexual behavior of the population at risk to safer sexual practices, which ultimately contributed to limiting the epidemic [152,153,154]. It seems that harm-reduction strategies and sex-positive messages were much more effective than the initial guidelines, which suggested strict abstinence [152,155].

The final important pillar of the epidemic containment was the broad dispensing of available vaccines. Pre- and post-exposure vaccination programs have played a key role in the strategies against mpox in North America and Europe. Unfortunately, the global response once again fell short of what was needed. Early in the 2022 mpox global outbreak, access to vaccines was unequal across high- and low-income countries. The availability of vaccines in the African countries where the virus had been endemic for decades was negligible. On the other hand, high-income countries secured large supplies of mpox vaccines [155]. In addition, as per August 2024, only two African countries had granted Emergency Use Authorization for the MVA-BN vaccine. As a result, during the current 2023–2024 outbreak originating in DRC, the population of the affected regions was not vaccinated, favoring the rapid spread of the virus. This led international stakeholders to take measures, including the procurement and donation of hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses to affected countries [156,157]. In order to facilitate timely and increased access to vaccines, the WHO proceeded with the prequalification approval of the MVA-BN vaccine in September 2024 [158].

11. CHALLENGES AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

While the WHO declared the end of the PHEIC for mpox in May 2023, sustained transmission of the Clade IIb virus has been established in humans, so the risk of resurgence remains a real public health threat, especially considering the current outbreak in African countries. Moreover, clinicians should be aware that previous infection and vaccination do not preclude mpox and they should investigate further when clinical suspicion is high. Data support the importance of vaccination and the recommendation that people who are at a high risk of MPXV infection should be prioritized to receive the mpox vaccine. This approach requires global vaccine availability in the areas historically affected by mpox and also in newly affected countries where access is limited. In the context of vaccine shortages when the number of those at risk exceeds vaccine availability, dose-sparing strategies or administration of at least a single dose of the vaccine to provide more widespread population coverage should be considered [138,159,160]. The protection of immunosuppressed people, including people with advanced HIV disease, through vaccination also represents a highly relevant area for research and for policymakers. Immune responses and immunity against Clade IIb MPXV are areas of active research, while phylogenetic and epidemiological analyses as well as randomized clinical trials are urgently needed.

There is also a need to bolster public health surveillance so that relevant public health agencies are notified of cases of suspected relapse, reinfection and breakthrough infection to further inform policies and guidelines. For this to be accomplished, a unified, country-driven strategy with decentralized laboratories properly equipped to enhance their sequencing capacity should be adopted. The development of point-of-care tests would enable better, large-scale testing within a reasonable timeframe. The adaptation of an integrated, individualized and evidence-based management of cases, with a focus on the research and development of new treatment strategies and options, can lead to better prognosis and reduced morbidity and mortality. Finally, future public health interventions and campaigns should engage key populations and communities to ensure greater acceptance and credibility of implemented policies [161]. Focusing on providing community-led structures with the authority and capacity to act is a proven strategy that can reduce costs and optimize efficacy (Figure 4).
A comprehensive review of monkeypox virus and mpox characteristics

Abstract

Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is the etiological agent of monkeypox (mpox), a zoonotic disease. MPXV is endemic in the forested regions of West and Central Africa, but the virus has recently spread globally, causing outbreaks in multiple non-endemic countries. In this paper, we review the characteristics of the virus, including its ecology, genomics, infection biology, and evolution. We estimate by phylogenomic molecular clock that the B.1 lineage responsible for the 2022 mpox outbreaks has been in circulation since 2016. We interrogate the host-virus interactions that modulate the virus infection biology, signal transduction, pathogenesis, and host immune responses. We highlight the changing pathophysiology and epidemiology of MPXV and summarize recent advances in the prevention and treatment of mpox. In addition, this review identifies knowledge gaps with respect to the virus and the disease, suggests future research directions to address the knowledge gaps, and proposes a One Health approach as an effective strategy to prevent current and future epidemics of mpox.

INTRODUCTION

Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is the etiological agent of a zoonotic disease called monkeypox (mpox). It is a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus belonging to Orthopoxvirus (OPXV) genus within the Poxviridae family and Chordopoxvirinae as the subfamily (Alakunle et al., 2020). Other members of this genus include Variola virus (VARV), Cowpox virus (CPXV), Vaccinia virus (VACV), Camelpox virus (CMLV), Taterapox virus (TATV) and Ectromelia virus (ECTV). MPXV is divided into Clade I and Clade II, with Clade II subclassified as Clade IIa and IIb (Happi et al., 2022). For five decades, MPXV was endemic in West and Central Africa (Earl et al., 2012), and exportation of the virus to non-endemic regions was rare (Alakunle and Okeke, 2022). However, the incidence (since 2017) of mpox outside endemic regions has increased, and the epidemiological profile of the disease within endemic regions has changed (Grothe et al., 2022). This may have led to the MPXV emergence and re-emergence in endemic countries in 2022 (Alakunle and Okeke, 2022). This paper will cover the current state of knowledge on the characteristics of MPXV and mpox, the infection biology, molecular pathogenesis, and evolution of MPXV as well as the clinical features, diagnosis, epidemiology, and therapeutic options against mpox. In addition, the review will critically interrogate and evaluate the contributions of viral, host, and anthropogenic factors to the emergence and reemergence of mpox across the globe.

Before 1970, there was no documented report of human MPXV infection, although the virus had previously caused infections in monkeys and apes (Arita and Henderson, 1968). Infections in monkeys were reported in laboratory/captive animals and were first identified in captive monkeys in Denmark in 1958. The first human mpox case emerged in a 9-month-old boy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in August 1970 (Ladnyj et al., 1972). Subsequently, six additional mpox cases were identified between September 1970 and April 1971 in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria (Lourie et al., 1972). Since then, MPXV has been reported in several countries and is endemic in Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the DRC, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, and South Sudan (Bass et al., 2013; World Health Organization, 2022a).

Figure 1
 displays the global mpox outbreak timeline. Between 1970 and 2021, the cases have been sporadic and geographically limited within endemic regions (Brown and Leggat, 2016; Titanji et al., 2022). Notably, the DRC is the only country that continuously reports yearly cases of mpox with tropical rainforest regions accounting for 98.7% of all cases pre-2022 (Brown and Leggat, 2016; Durski et al., 2018). In Nigeria, sporadic cases were reported in the 1970s; however, re-emergence of the disease started in 2017 with an eleven-year-old boy as the index case in Bayelsa state (Yinka-Ogunleye et al., 2018). At the end of 2017, Nigeria recorded 88 cases, and during this outbreak, travel-related cases in non-endemic countries were reported, including the United Kingdom (UK), the United States of America (USA), Israel, and Singapore, between 2018 and 2021 (Adegboye et al., 2022).

The first mpox outbreak in a non-endemic country was reported in 2003 in the USA linked to importation of rodents from Ghana (
Figure 1
) (Anderson et al., 2003; Centre for Disease Control, 2003; Croft et al., 2007). By the end of the outbreak, 47 people had been infected (10 probable and 37 confirmed cases) (Centre for Disease Control, 2003; Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC), 2023). There were no other travel-related cases reported until 2018. Between 2018 to 2021, 11 travel-related mpox cases were recorded in the UK, Singapore, Israel, and the USA (
Figure 1
). Of these, four resulted in secondary cases: one healthcare worker in the UK was infected by contaminated bedding, an adult and a child from a family from the UK had a travel history to Nigeria, and one traveler to Israel who had visited Nigeria in 2018. Between 2019 and 2021, a total of seven mpox outbreaks occurred outside Africa in Singapore, the UK and the USA (
Figure 1
). All travel related cases originated in Nigeria, with high-throughput sequencing confirming it as Clade II (Vaughan et al., 2018; Erez et al., 2019; Fang et al., 2020; Hobson et al., 2021; Bunge et al., 2022). Between 2017 and October 30, 2022, a total of 830 cases were recorded in 33 out of 36 states in Nigeria (Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), 2022).

The current global mpox outbreak started in May 2022 (Alakunle et al., 2020; Adegboye et al., 2022) and was declared a public health emergency of international concern on July 23, 2022 (Nuzzo et al., 2022). As of August 02, 2023, there were a total of 88,600 laboratory-confirmed cases and 152 deaths (case-fatality rate, 0.17%) across 113 countries including 106 countries that have not historically reported mpox (
Figures 2A-C
) (World Health Organization, 2022). The Americas recorded the highest number of cases during the 2022 mpox outbreak, with the USA (n = 29,513) and Brazil (n = 10,168) accounting for 48.32% of the total cases (
Figure 2C
). Other notable affected countries include Spain (n = 7,408), France (n = 4,110), Colombia (n = 3,880), the UK (n = 3,730), Germany (n = 3,673), Peru (n = 3,561), Mexico (n = 3,455), and Canada (n = 1,459). In Africa, Nigeria has the highest mpox cases with 634 cases.

ECOLOGY, HOST RANGE, TISSUE AND CELL TROPISM

Despite the name, monkeypox, monkeys are not the genuine reservoir of MPXV. Several animals can naturally or experimentally be infected with MPXV (
Table 1
) (Li et al., 2023), but the natural host reservoir remains elusive. While specific host-cell receptors are responsible for cell tropism, the specificity of MPXV is yet to be determined. Factors like the monkeypox inhibitor of complement enzymes (MOPICE) and complement control protein (CCP) can influence the viral cellular and tissue tropism (Hudson et al., 2012). Nonetheless, a wide spectrum of tissue and host tropism is expected, which may explain the possibility of MPXV establishing animal reservoirs in non-endemic regions (Kmiec and Kirchhoff, 2022). Organs such as ovaries, kidneys, heart, brain, pancreas, liver, and lung have been identified as some of the tissue tropism for MPXV (Arthur et al., 2022). However, specific virus ligands remain unidentified. The inability to identify specific virus ligands and cognate host receptors for MPXV tropism suggests that the virus uses many alternative ligands to successfully invade host cells or the host receptors have functional redundancy to the virus ligand. Spillover to humans (zoonotic transmission) might arise from the disruptions of the natural habitats of wild animals (Domán et al., 2022). This could occur via various routes, including aerosol, direct contact, and fomite transmission (Walker, 2022). It is believed that the MPXV outbreaks in Africa prior to 2022 occurred as a result of a spillover from animals to humans (Faye et al., 2018; Kabuga and El Zowalaty, 2019; Petersen et al., 2019b; Happi et al., 2022; Riopelle et al., 2022). Thus, there is a likelihood of MPXV being sustained in the spillover due to the wide geographical coverage of the MPXV hosts (Tu, 2015).

GENOMICS, PHYLOGENOMICS, PHYLODYNAMICS, AND EVOLUTION

MPXV GENOME AND GENE CONTENT

MPXV has a long and complex genome of 196 Kbp - 211 Kbp with a conserved central region and variable inverted terminal repeats (ITR) (
Figure 3A
). Within MPXV clades, Clade I isolates have more uniform genome length (196 Kbp - 199 Kbp) than Clade II isolates (196 Kbp - 211 Kbp). The length of MXPV ITR varies between 6.5 Kbp to 17.5 Kbp (Shchelkunov et al., 2002; Likos et al., 2005; Nakazawa et al., 2013). Our genomic comparison of MPXV clades (Clade I, n=23; Clade IIa, n=13 and Clade IIb, n=161) indicated similar gene synteny (excluding the ITR), but slight differences in the gene content among the clades due to some genes that are missing or truncated in either one or two clades. The results are consistent with a previous study (Forni et al., 2022a) which indicates that four genes (D14L, D15L, D16L and D17L) are missing and three genes (D4L, B14L and B15L) are truncated in Clade II. Furthermore, the homologue of VACV-Cop E5R is only absent in Clade I and three genes (K1R, homologues of VACV-Cop A47L and VACV-Cop B11R) are truncated. Another major difference is the gene content of their left terminal in which Clade IIa contains four genes (N3R, N2R, N1R and R1R) that are absent in Clade I and IIb. However, these four genes are present on the right terminal of all clades. Furthermore, Clade I and IIb have theD2L gene. Within Clade IIb, gene content of the lineage A and B.1 are similar.

PHYLOGENOMICS AND PHYLODYNAMICS

Our Bayesian phylogenetic (BI) analysis of 62 non-recombinant conserved genes (Diaz-Cánova et al., 2022a) from 197 MPXV isolates resolved MPXV into three monophyletic clades, namely Clade I (Congo Basin Clade), Clade IIa (West Africa Clade) and Clade IIb consisting majorly of human MPXV (hMPXV) isolated between 2017-2022 (
Figure 3B
). Clade IIb was further divided into lineages: A (n=11), A.1 (n=11), A.2 (n=1), A.3 (n=1), and B.1 (n=135) as assigned by the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) (https://gisaid.org/). MPXV tree topology reported here is similar to that of the trees reported previously (Gigante et al., 2022; Isidro et al., 2022; Luna et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). Isidro et al. reported that the transition from A.1/A.1.1 to B.1 is characterized by a long, divergent branch (Isidro et al., 2022) which suggests accelerated microevolution. The findings of this current study (
Figure 3B
) agree with the suggestion.

Lineage A (hMPXV-1A) corresponds to the 2017–2019 outbreak, although it contains strains isolated after this time frame (
Figure 3B
) and this observation has been reported by others (Gigante et al., 2022). A recent study showed that new Nigerian hMPXV genomes isolated in 2019-2020 were identified as belonging to the lineage A (Ndodo et al., 2023). Lineage B.1 contains most hMPXV genomes from 2022 (
Figure 3B
). It is poorly resolved, and its sub-lineages cannot be unequivocally assigned (
Figure 3B
). The low clade supports are probably due to very low genetic variability among isolates (Scarpa et al., 2022). Polytomy within lineage B.1 could be an indication of uncertainty in the relatedness of isolates or the belief that those isolates evolved independently from a single origin (Slowinski, 2001; Phylogenetic pitchforks - Understanding Evolution, 2023), although recombination cannot be excluded (Yeh et al., 2022).

Furthermore, molecular dating analysis was carried out on the 62 non-recombinant conserved genes of 197 MPXV isolates to estimate the evolutionary rate and the time of the Most Recent Ancestor (tMRCA) (
Figure 3C
). TempEst analysis showed temporal signal in the dataset (R=0.65). Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree (
Figure 3C
) demonstrated that MPXV emerged at 1730 (95% high posterior density interval (HPD), 1663 – 1790) with a mean evolutionary rate estimated to be 5.68 × 10−6 (subs/site/year), with 95% HPD of 4.53 × 10−6 − 6.86 × 10−6 subs/site/year. A recent publication estimated the substitution rate to be 5 x 10-6 (Dumonteil et al., 2023) which is in agreement with our result, but previous estimations of the substitution rates of Clades I and IIa were smaller (Gigante et al., 2022). Clades I, IIa, and IIb were estimated to have emerged in 1956, 1928, and 1938, respectively which is earlier by 33, 47, and 97 years as estimated by Forni et al. (Forni et al., 2022b). Lineage A and B.1 were estimated to have a tMRCA of 1998 (95% HPD, 1990 - 2006) and 2016 (95% HPD, 2014 – 2018), respectively. Our dating analysis put the emergence of the B.1 lineage six years earlier than that estimated by Luna et al. (Luna et al., 2022) and Nextclade (https://clades.nextstrain.org/). This discrepancy may be explained by molecular dating methods used (ML-TSP versus BI-MCC). We hypothesize that the emergence of lineage A about 1998 allowed enough time for lineage A evolution and that may explain the long divergent branch length from lineage A to B.1. Similarly, the emergence of lineage B.1 in 2016 in tandem with clustering of some 2022 isolates within the lineage A (2017-2019) support cryptic transmission of the B.1 viruses prior to the current 2022 outbreak in multiple non-endemic countries (Alakunle and Okeke, 2022; Dumonteil et al., 2023). A recent molecular clock analysis based on accumulation of APOBEC3 (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypetide 3)-type mutations inferred that MPXV with APOBEC3 editing has been in circulation since at least 2016 (O’Toole et al., 2023), and this is in agreement with our molecular dating reported herein although their interpretation differs from ours. While we infer that B.1 lineage emerged in 2016, O`Toole et al. concluded that APOBEC3-type mutations, a predictor of human-to-human transmission emerged in 2016. The close phylogenetic relationship between A.1 isolates from Nigeria (in particular EPI_ISL_15370077) with B.1 suggests a single origin for lineage B.1.

MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS AND RECOMBINATION

Our mutational analysis revealed that lineage B.1 has 66-86 nucleotide substitutions (60 consensus) and 28-39 amino acid substitutions (26 consensus) compared to reference genome NC_063383.1, MPXV from 2018 (
Figures 3D, E
). Consensus substitutions predominantly affect genes responsible for host/immune modulation and viral replication/transcription (
Figure 3E
). B21R (OPG210) codes for a T cell suppressor; our analysis demonstrated that this open reading frame (ORF) contained three consensus amino acid substitutions (D209N, P722S, and M1741I). A18R (OPG145) contained three substitutions (E62K, R243Q, and E435K). Excluding G8R (OPG093) with two substitutions, all the other affected ORFs contained one consensus amino acid substitution each (
Figure 3E
). The impact of these substitutions on the pathogenicity, transmissibility, immune evasion, and host specificity of MPXV remains unknown. The E353K substitution within F13L (OPG057) affects the target for the antiviral agent, tecovirimat; however, functional studies have not revealed any effect on the efficacy of the drug (Gigante et al., 2022). Wang et al. also reported three mutations in OPG210 protein in MPXV 2022 outbreak strains (Wang et al., 2022). Additionally, they showed that this protein together with other nine proteins (D2L‐like, OPG023, OPG047, OPG071, OPG105, OPG109, A27L‐like, OPG153, and OPG188 proteins) have more mutations compared to the other MPXV proteins (Wang et al., 2022).

In contrast to our study, previous mutational studies have reported fewer consensus substitutions (Isidro et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Wassenaar et al., 2022). They reported 46 shared mutations in MPXV genomes from 2022 outbreak compared with NC_063383 (Chen et al., 2005; Isidro et al., 2022). However the number of mutations identified here and in other studies is higher than one would expect for MPXV (Chen et al., 2005; Isidro et al., 2022; Ndodo et al., 2023), based on the low substitution rate of OPXV (Firth et al., 2010). The accelerated evolution of MPXV has been attributed to the human APOBEC3 (Isidro et al., 2022; O’Toole and Rambaut, 2022; Wang et al., 2022). Since most mutations identified here (
Figure 3D
) and elsewhere were GA>AA and TC>TT mutations, which are compatible with APOBEC3 activity. APOBEC3 is a cytidine deaminase known to play important functions in innate anti-viral immunity (Harris and Dudley, 2015; Salter et al., 2016). Evidence for the accumulation of APOBEC3 enriched substitutions in MPXV isolates has been reported since 2017, which corresponds to the detection of lineage A (Gigante et al., 2022). Ever since, every year, there has been an increase in APOBEC3-like mutations in MPXV (Ndodo et al., 2023). This mutational pattern has become more pronounced as suggested from more recent isolates (B.1) (Gigante et al., 2022; Ndodo et al., 2023), (
Figure 3D
). The recent pattern of upsurge of APOBEC3 derived mutations may be an indication of a change in virus-host interaction such as sustained human-human transmission (Ndodo et al., 2023) or a new route of infection (Gigante et al., 2022). Gigante et al. (Gigante et al., 2022) suggested the possibility of recombination in MPXV following observation of three sequences that showed a chimeric pattern in their genomes, although assembly errors could be a plausible explanation. Recently, tandem repeats and linkage disequilibrium analysis provided evidence of natural recombination in lineage B.1 (Yeh et al., 2022).

Poxvirus mature particles are ovoid or brick-shaped with surface tubules and have a characteristic dumbbell-shaped nucleoprotein core containing the viral genome (Shchelkunov et al., 2001). MPXV virions are ~200 nm in diameter and ~300 nm in length (Wenner et al., 1968). Like other OPXVs, MPXV forms three distinct infectious virus particles: intracellular mature virus (IMV), cell associated enveloped virus (CEV) and extracellular enveloped virus (EEV) although CEV and EEV are morphologically and structurally indistinguishable. Morphogenesis and transmission of IMV, CEV, and EEV are described in
Figure 4A

Observations of cynomolgus monkeys infected with MPXV gave the first indications of the pathogenic role of this virus with intramuscular injection of the virus leading to an intense inflammatory immune response (Wenner et al., 1968, 1969). The pathogenesis of MPXV has also been studied in other animals, including rabbits, rodents and prairie dogs (Hutson et al., 2009; Bunge et al., 2022). Studies in monkeys, mice, and prairie dogs demonstrated that Clade I viruses are more virulent than Clade II strains, which reflects the situation in humans (Saijo et al., 2009; Hutson et al., 2010; Bunge et al., 2022; Americo et al., 2023; Falendysz et al., 2023). Except for disease severity, the clinical features of the two clades are similar (Kipkorir et al., 2022).

MPXV infection has an incubation period of 5–21 days and the most common symptoms for the 2022 human mpox outbreak in non-endemic regions based on 48,622 patients were skin lesions (95%), fever (58%), lymphadenopathy (53%), fatigue/asthenia (39%), myalgia (31%), and headache (30%) (Liu et al., 2023). Regarding skin lesions, anogenital lesions were most frequent (66%), followed by lesions on the trunk/torso (48%), face/head (39%), and extremities (~30%) (Liu et al., 2023). This is in contrast with previous human mpox outbreaks from 1980-2022 where skin lesions were most common on the face and extremities (Pourriyahi et al., 2023). Lymphadenopathy, which typically occurs 1-2 days before rash, is a distinct feature of MPXV which is used to distinguish it from smallpox and chickenpox (Altindis et al., 2022; McCarthy, 2022). The morphological progression of the rash is macular, popular, vesicular, and pustular lesions. The crust formed by pustules desquamate after 1-2 weeks (Altindis et al., 2022; McCarthy, 2022; Nakhaie et al., 2022). In the current outbreak, inguinal lymphadenopathy was more frequent than cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy (Liu et al., 2023), whereas in previous outbreaks in endemic countries submandibular, cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy were more frequent (Damon, 2011). The differences in clinical symptoms between human mpox infections before 2022 and the current outbreak are probably the result of different virus strain (Clade I versus Clade II, respectively) and patient group (both female and male youngsters versus mainly adult men having sex with men). In men having sex with men (MSM), atypical clinical symptoms such as genital lesions and anal ulcers were observed (Mitjà et al., 2022; Bragazzi et al., 2023).

MPXV can enter the host via the oral/respiratory tract, infecting the oral and respiratory tract mucosae, with the upper, middle and lower airway epithelium as main targets for primary infection (Giulio and Eckburg, 2004; Damon, 2011; Kipkorir et al., 2022; Mitjà et al., 2022). MPXV can directly infect damaged skin, and replicate in keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (Mitjà et al., 2022). From the initial infection sites, virus can spread to draining lymph nodes, where the virus can replicate. MPXV can subsequently reach the tonsils, the spleen, and the liver. Replication in these organs results in a second viraemia wave, enabling the virus to access distant organs such as the lung, kidneys, intestines, and skin and causing recognizable clinical manifestation (Giulio and Eckburg, 2004; Damon, 2011; Kipkorir et al., 2022; Mitjà et al., 2022).

Comparison of the Clade I and II strains has provided an indication which viral gene products may be responsible for their difference in virulence. The D14L gene which encodes valosin-containing protein (VCP)-MPXV, also known as CCP or MOPICE, is the orthologue of VACV secreted complement C3b/C4b-binding protein VACV-Cop C3L (Chen et al., 2005). This protein is known to inhibit the complement and to contribute to virulence (Kotwal et al., 1990; Isaacs et al., 1992). Compared to the VACV protein, VCP-MPXV/MOPICE is truncated due to a single nucleotide deletion in the D14L gene leading to a stop codon (Uvarova and Shchelkunov, 2001). The gene is absent from Clade II strains due to ~10 kbp deletion (Likos et al., 2005). Deletion of the C3L gene caused VACV attenuation in infected animal models (Isaacs et al., 1992; DeHaven et al., 2010; Girgis et al., 2011). Studies with Clade I MPXV with deleted D14L showed that intranasal infection of prairie dogs resulted in decreased morbidity and mortality. However, ablation of D14L did not significantly affect virus replication compared to animals infected with control Clade I virus. On the other hand, Clade II virus with inserted D14L gene did not have virulence compared to Clade I virus and no apparent effect on disease-associated mortality compared to control Clade II virus was observed (Hudson et al., 2012). So, other factors besides VCP-MPXV/MOPICE are necessary to explain the difference in virulence between Clade I and II MPXV.

Other candidate virulence genes include BR-203, BR-209, and the OPXV major histocompatibility complex class I–like protein orthologue (OMCP or N3R) (Chen et al., 2005; Likos et al., 2005). BR-203 protein is an orthologue to the myxoma virus M-T4, which plays a role in avoiding apoptosis of infected lymphocytes, hence promoting viral spread within the host (Barry et al., 1997; Weaver and Isaacs, 2008). Myxoma virus expressing C-terminal truncated M-T4 caused increased inflammatory response compared to rabbits infected with wildtype virus, whereas challenging with virus lacking M-T4 resulted in disease attenuation (Barry et al., 1997; Hnatiuk et al., 1999). Thus, BR-203 may have a dual function in protecting infected lymphocytes from apoptosis and in modulating the inflammatory response to virus infection.

The BR-209 gene encodes a 326 aa interleukin-1β (IL-1β) binding protein, which prevents IL-1β from interacting with the IL-1 receptor. Mice intranasally infected with VACV lacking IL-1β binding protein developed a more severe illness than wildtype virus (Alcami and Smith, 1992). Perturbing the IL-1 signaling pathway dampens the innate and acquired immunity, explaining the virulent action of the IL-1β binding protein (Dinarello, 2018). Interestingly, the BR-209 gene of Clade I strains has two ORFs that can encode a putative N-terminal protein fragment of 210 aa and a C-terminal protein fragment of 126 aa, whereas the Clade II strains encode a putative N-terminal 163 aa polypeptide and a C-terminal 132 aa fragment (Weaver and Isaacs, 2008). It is unknown if any of the fragments function in a way similar to the full-length protein, nor if the differences in the length of the N-terminal fragments of Clade I versus Clade II strains of MPXV contribute to the differences in virulence (Weaver and Isaacs, 2008).

The OMCP gene (N3R) from Clade I strains isolated in the DRC carries a 628 bp deletion, which removes the 5’region of the N3R gene (which encodes the OMCP) and the N2R gene (encoding a 73 aa polypeptide with unknown function) (Kugelman et al., 2014). OMPC functions as soluble natural killer group 2, member D receptor (NKG2D) ligand, possibly representing a strategy to avoid NK-cell-mediated killing (Campbell et al., 2007; Lazear et al., 2013). Based on the clinical metadata, it was suggested that the deletion is associated with increased human-to-human transmission and pathogenicity compared to Clade IIa and Clade IIb isolates (Forni et al., 2022a).

The Clade I strain also contains truncated orthologues of VACV-Cop E3L and VACV-Cop K3L, two proteins that function in interferon (IFN) resistance (Weaver and Isaacs, 2008). Clade I and Clade II genomes differ also in VACV-CopH5R (the VACV orthologue encodes a late transcription factor, which plays a role in viral replication, transcription and morphogenesis (Van Vliet et al., 2009), VACV-Cop A9L (VACV orthologue encodes a morphogenesis factor) (Van Vliet et al., 2009), VACV-Cop A50R (VACV orthologue encodes a DNA ligase) (Van Vliet et al., 2009)), and VACV-Cop A36R (playing role in actin tail formation) (Wolffe et al., 1998)). The exact mechanisms by which these proteins may also contribute to differences in pathogenicity between Clade I and II strains remains elusive.

SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION AND PATHWAYS

Manipulation of signaling pathways promotes viral replication and determines disease outcomes, mainly by targeting cell growth and immune responses (Krajcsi and Wold, 1998; Greber, 2002). MPXV infection suppresses expression of host genes whose products are implicated in regulation of histone expression, cytoskeletal rearrangements, cell cycle progression, IFN-associated genes, and signaling pathways such as the nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and metabolic pathways (Alkhalil et al., 2010; Rubins et al., 2011; Xuan et al., 2022).

The NFκB pathway plays pivotal roles in inflammation and immunity (Shao-Cong Sun, 2017). NFκB is typically found as a cytosolic trimer of p65/p50 and the inhibitor protein IκB. Phosphorylation of IκB by the trimer IKKα/IKKβ/IKKγ results in the release and activation of p65/p50, which translocate to the nucleus and act as a transcription factor (Hayden and Ghosh, 2008) (
Figure 4B
). Ankyrin proteins from OPXVs can inhibit the NFκB pathway by interfering with different components of this pathway (Shisler and Jin, 2004; Chen et al., 2008; Mohamed and McFadden, 2009; Ember et al., 2012; Mansur et al., 2013; Herbert et al., 2015). MPXV genome encodes the ankyrin-like proteins J3L, D1L, D7L, D9L, O1L, C1L, B5R, B17R, N4R, and J1R (Shchelkunov et al., 2002; Lum et al., 2022), but their exact function remains to be determined. In addition, the MPXV BCL2-like proteins A47R, B13R, C6R, and P1L can prevent activation of the NFκB pathway (Lum et al., 2022). The MPXV B1R gene encodes the VACV Kelch-like protein A55, which inhibits the NFκB pathway and stimulates CD8+ T cell proliferation (Lysakova-Devine et al., 2010). However, it remains to be determined whether B1R exerts a similar function.

The Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway mediates cellular responses to cytokines and growth factors (Mythology, 1990). H1L inactivates STAT1, and C6R blocks STAT2 (Mann et al., 2008; Stuart et al., 2016). Whether the MPXV H1L and D11L orthologues act similarly has not been investigated (
Figure 4B
).

The VACV epidermal growth factor homologue VGF (C11R) usurps the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway to provoke cell proliferation and to stimulate efficient virus spread and pathogenesis (Buller et al., 1988; Beerli et al., 2019). The D3R gene (OPG019) encodes an EGF homologue that might activate the EGFR pathway and enhance viral dissemination. VACV-Cop F11L also promotes viral spreading by inhibiting the RhoA signaling pathway (Beerli et al., 2019). It is not known whether the MPXV orthologue C17L possesses the same function.

Circumventing apoptosis is used by viruses to achieve productive replication. VACV F1L and N1L proteins can prevent apoptosis by inhibiting pro-apoptotic proteins BAK, BID, BAD, and BAX (Aoyagi et al., 2006; Cooray et al., 2007). It is unknown whether the MPXV C7L and P1L isologues have similar functions. Other MPXV genes that prevent apoptosis include B12R, B19R, D5R, and F3L (Lum et al., 2022). B12 is a serine protease and its VACV orthologue B13R has been shown to be a caspase inhibitor (Li and Beg, 2000).

Signal transduction is often mediated through a cascade of phosphorylation events (Denhardt, 1996). Kindrachuk et al. compared the phosphorylation pattern of host cell proteins after Clade I or Clade II MPXV infection (Kindrachuk et al., 2012). They found that Clade I MPXV infection down-regulated pathways related to cell proliferation and apoptosis as compared with Clade II MPXV. Differences in MPXV-induced posttranslational modification may explain the differences in virulence between MPXV clades.

HOST IMMUNE RESPONSE AND VIRUS IMMUNE DECOY MECHANISMS

HOST IMMUNE RESPONSE

Human infection with MPXV is associated with increased levels of ILs, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and CCL5 (Johnston et al., 2015), and a significant decrease in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IFN-γ, and IL-2 and IL-12 (Li et al., 2022). MPXV infection provokes IgM and IgG antibodies, long-term persistence of residual IgG-memory B cells, and a rapid expansion of activated effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells followed by a decrease over time (Agrati et al., 2022; Mitjà et al., 2022). MPXV also interferes with adaptive immune responses of antiviral CD8 + and CD4 + T cell responses via inhibiting T cell receptor-mediated T cell activation (Hammarlund et al., 2008).

EVASION HOST IMMUNE DEFENSE

Because of the high homology between the MPXV genes and the corresponding OPXV orthologues, it is assumed and, in some cases, demonstrated that MPXV applies similar strategies to evade the host immune defense system. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) family functions as pattern recognition receptors, which recognize damage-associated molecular patterns such as viral dsRNA. Binding of viral dsRNA to specific TLR members triggers the expression of proinflammatory molecules involved in host anti-viral responses and subsequent activation of the adaptive immune defense system (Mogensen, 2009). The VAVC A46 protein inhibits the TLR4 signaling pathway (Lysakova-Devine et al., 2010). However, it is unknown whether the MPXV orthologue A47 has the same property, but the A47 protein has structural similarities to VACV protein A52R, which can inhibit the TLR3 and TLR4 signaling pathways (Bowie et al., 2000; Harte et al., 2003), underscoring a role for MPXV A47 in interfering with TLR signaling. MPXV produces low levels of dsRNA intermediates (Arndt et al., 2016), but whether these are recognized by TLR3 has not been investigated, although transcriptome analysis of MPXV-infected cells revealed repression of TLR3 target genes (Rubins et al., 2011). dsRNA can also activate kinase R (PKR), which mediates phosphorylation of eIF2α, resulting in the inhibition of viral and cellular mRNA translation (Pears, 1995). VACV E3 and K3 are inhibitors of PKR, allowing VACV to evade an antiviral response (Seet et al., 2003; Deng et al., 2008). The N-terminal domain of VACV E3 protein is absolutely required for the interaction with dsRNA (White and Jacobs, 2012). MPXV F3 protein is the VACV E3 protein homologue with a 37 aa truncation at the amino terminus (Arndt et al., 2015), suggesting that MPXV F3 does not bind dsRNA. However, MPXV can inhibit host immune responses, although a recombinant VACV expressing the MPXV F3L gene did not inhibit host PKR activation (Arndt et al., 2015), suggesting that MPXV has evolved to encode for yet undiscovered proteins that compensate for the missing N-terminal amino acids of F3 in limiting host antiviral activities. As previously mentioned, MPXV CCP (D14L gene) is completely absent in Clade II isolates, whereas the Clade I strains are predicted to express CCP, albeit with a truncated fourth short consensus repeat (Yeh and Contreras, 2022). Loss of expression of CCP/MOPICE limited the adaptive immune response against MPXV infection in rhesus macaques (Estep et al., 2011).

IFNs are main effectors of the innate immune response and can inhibit virus replication (Seet et al., 2003; Randall and Goodbourn, 2008). The MPXV B16 protein (VACV B19 orthologue) is a secreted type I IFN inhibitor and suppresses the antiviral type I IFN-induced signaling pathway (Fernández de Marco et al., 2010). VACV K7 abrogates IFN signaling by destabilizing IFN-regulated factor 3 (IRF3) and inhibits NFκB activation, whereas VACV H1 can block IFN signaling (Benfield et al., 2013; Liu and Moss, 2018). Whether the MPXV D9 and H1 orthologues have the same function remains to be proven, but both proteins are predicted to interact with several cellular proteins of the immune system (Mann et al., 2008; Kumar et al., 2023). VACV E3 perturbs IFN signaling by binding host Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1). The MPXV E3 orthologue (F3) perturbs the IFN pathway, but whether in a ZBP1-dependent manner needs to be established. The DNA-sensing receptor pathway cGAS/STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of interferon genes) can activate the IFN and NFκB pathways (Motwani et al., 2019). The VACV B16 and B8 proteins block IFN signaling by operating as soluble IFN-α and IFN-γ receptors, respectively (Alcamí and Smith, 1995; Colamonici et al., 1995). The MPXV ORF B16R and B9R encode functional homologues (Shchelkunov et al., 2002). OPXVs encode poxins that degrade 2′,3′ cGAMP and thereby inhibit cGAS/STING signaling (Eaglesham et al., 2019). Poxin is conserved in MPXV where it is fused to an additional C-terminal domain previously noted to have homology with human schlafen proteins (VACV B2R = MPXV B4R) (Eaglesham et al., 2019), hence MPXV may evade the immune system by targeting the cGAS/STING pathway.

MPXV can dodge the immune system by targeting the antiviral cytokine TNFα and other immunomodulating molecules. The MPXV-encoded cytokine response-modifying protein B (CrmB; J2L or OPG002) functions as a decoy receptor for TNFα (Gileva et al., 2006). The C-terminal domain of VACV CrmB can bind CCL28, CCL25, CXC motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), CXCL13 and CXCL14 (Alejo et al., 2006). It is unknown whether MPXV CrmB interacts with these chemokines, but the amino acid sequence of the corresponding domain in MPXV CrmB differs significantly (Gileva et al., 2006).

Natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cells (CTL) play a crucial role in eliminating viral infections. Although the number of NK cells expand significantly in peripheral blood and lymph nodes in MPXV-infected rhesus macaques, their migrating capacity was reduced, and several functions such as expression of chemokine receptors (including CCR5, CCR6 and CXCR3) and secretion of IFNγ and TNFα were impaired (Song et al., 2013). The importance of NK cells in controlling MPXV viral load was demonstrated in the highly vulnerable to OPXV infection CAST/EiJ mouse strain owing to low numbers of NK cells. IL-15 treatment, known to increase the numbers of IFNγ-secreting NK cells and CD8+ T cells, protected CAST/EiJ mice from lethal MPXV infection even when both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were depleted. This implies that the expanded NK cells were responsible for the protective effect (Al-musa et al., 2022; Lum et al., 2022).

MPXV protein B10 avoids detection of virus-infected cells by CTL by impairing peptide loading and MHC-I trafficking within the endoplasmic reticulum. However, NK cells continually screen cells via NKG2D for the absence of MHC-I, thereby ensuring that the MHC system is not compromised (Lum et al., 2022). MPXV-infected cells with downregulated MHC-I expression overcomes detection by NK cells by secreting the OCMP protein that binds NKG2D and suppress the typical NKG2D-dependent NK cell lysis of cells that do not express MHC-I (Lum et al., 2022) (
Figure 4C
). IL-18, an IFNγ-inducing factor, stimulates the synthesis of various cytokines and chemokines, regulates Th1 and Th2 cell responses, and activates NK and CTL (Seet et al., 2003). OPXVs block IL-18 activities by producing an IL-18 binding protein (Born et al., 2000). The MPXV D6L gene encodes such IL-18 binding protein (Shchelkunov et al., 2002).

The MPXV J3R and A41L genes encode chemokine binding proteins (Shchelkunov et al., 2002), which are assumed to destroy the chemokine concentration gradient resulting in decreased neutrophil migration in tissues infected with MPXV and thus reducing viral virulence and inflammatory response (Bahar et al., 2008).

The complement system, which forms an essential part of the innate immune system is activated early in MPXV infection in mice, and is crucial for viral control (Moulton et al., 2008). MPXV MOPICE which from studies with VARV and VACV MOPICE was found to inhibit activation of the complement pathway (Liszewski et al., 2006). MOPICE modulates the antiviral immune response as observed by enhanced viral replication in vivo and dampened adaptive immune response in rhesus macaques infected with MPXV lacking MOPICE expression (Estep et al., 2011; Hudson et al., 2012). Because of the absence of the D14L gene in the Clade II, the virus and virus-infected cells would be predicted to be susceptible to the host complement attack. However, the expression of MOPICE in Clade II did not increase its virulence (Hudson et al., 2012), demonstrating that MOPICE is not the sole determinant of differences in viral virulence between the two clades.

Less is known how MPXV may interfere with the adaptive immune system. MPXV interferes with adaptive immune responses of antiviral CD8 + and CD4 + T cell responses via inhibiting T cell receptor-mediated T cell activation (Hammarlund et al., 2008).VACV A35 blocks immune priming of T lymphocytes by interfering with MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation. Moreover, infection studies in cells with MPXV lacking the A35R gene demonstrated that A35 inhibits production of cytokines and chemokines (Rehm et al., 2011). MPXV A35 analogue, A37, might suppress presentation of viral antigens to immune cells and help the virus to evade the host immune defense system. However, MPXV does not seem to interfere with MHC expression or intracellular transport of MHC molecules (Hammarlund et al., 2008).

EPIDEMIOLOGY

DEMOGRAPHIC AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS

Surveillance data on mpox in endemic countries during different periods between 1970-2015 showed that 71%-83% of the disease occurred in children (<10 years of age) and 51%-67% in males (Breman et al., 1980; Heymann et al., 1998; Rimoin et al., 2011). In contrast, the median age for the 2017-2018 outbreak in Nigeria was 29 years, with males accounting for 64% of the cases (Yinka-Ogunleye et al., 2019). However, for the 2022 multi-country outbreak, males accounted for 96.8% of the cases, and the median age was 34 years (Interquartile range: 29 – 41) (World Health Organization., 2022). In the African region, children (0-9 years of age) accounted for 23.08% of mpox cases compared to <1% in Europe and the Americas. Notably, the male-to-female ratio in Africa is also markedly lower than in other regions (
Figures 5A-C
) (World Health Organization, 2022).

CASE FATALITY RATE

Before the 2022 outbreak, the overall pooled estimated case fatality rate (CFR) was 8.7% and varied by the clade of the virus (Bunge et al., 2022). The pooled CFR for Clade II was 3.6% and 10.6% for Clade I (Bunge et al., 2022). The 2022 outbreak has an estimated CFR of 0.08% (World Health Organization, 2022). The low CFR in the current outbreak may be related to several factors, including the fact that the Clade II has a CFR of <1%, active surveillance, early diagnosis, and treatment (World Health Organization, 2022b).

SECONDARY ATTACK RATE

Over the past five decades, the secondary attack rate for mpox has been stable and ranges from 0% to 10.2% (Breman et al., 1977; Merouze and Lesoin, 1983; Tchokoteu et al., 1991; McCollum et al., 2014; Besombes et al., 2019; Ye et al., 2019). Higher estimates were reported in the 2013 outbreak in the DRC (50% among 16 households) and Nigeria (71% in the 2017- 2018 outbreak from a single household) (Nolen et al., 2015; Beer and Bhargavi Rao, 2019; Bunge et al., 2022). However, it is imperative to note that it is unclear how the high estimates were obtained and thus may likely be overestimated (Beer and Bhargavi Rao, 2019).

VIRUS REPRODUCTION NUMBER

Reproduction number (R0) is the number of secondary cases anticipated to develop from a single primary case in a naive population (Beer and Bhargavi Rao, 2019). While historical data on R0 is limited, published evidence from DRC’s active surveillance between 1980 and 1984 estimated R0 to be 0.8 (Beer and Bhargavi Rao, 2019), implying that transmission is ineffective as a human-to-human epidemic is likely to die out (Beer and Bhargavi Rao, 2019). However, early estimations of the R0 in the 2022 outbreak in non-endemic countries showed a high variability ranging from 1.54 (Belgium) to 3.62 (Germany), with a median of 2.44 (Branda et al., 2023). This suggests sustained human-to-human transmission, possibly due to several contributing factors, including different social and/or sexual behaviors, different MPXV variants, population density or other unknown causes (Branda et al., 2023). While the early estimations indicated sustained transmission, the outbreak has slowed down with case reductions. This could be due to behavior change, infection induced immunity, and vaccinations.

RISK FACTORS (SEXUAL AND SOCIAL NETWORKS, SMALLPOX VACCINATION) AND CO-MORBIDITIES

Transmission of MPXV can occur from animal-to-human (zoonotic) and from human-to-human (interhuman). Zoonotic transmission usually happens through contact with an infected animal’s bodily fluid or through a bite or scratch (Reynolds et al., 2007). Exposure to animal reservoirs, especially in regions with deforestation enhancing animal-human contact, and uncooked meat products are major risk factors for zoonotic transmission (Kipkorir et al., 2022). During the 2003 USA outbreak, exposure was classified as “non-invasive” (touching an infected animal) or “complex” (invasive bite from an ill animal; non-invasive exposure i.e., any exposure that did not break the skin) (Reynolds et al., 2018). Patients with complex exposures were more likely to develop systemic illness compared to those with non-invasive exposure (Reynolds et al., 2018). Dewitt et al. predicted the MPXV mode of transmission in most 2022 studies to be caused by inter-human transmission (Dewitt et al., 2022) (
Figure 5D
). Large respiratory droplets, bodily fluids, contaminated fomites, and viral shedding through feces are also considered risk factors for viral transmission (Rimoin et al., 2010; Sklenovská and Van Ranst, 2018; El Eid et al., 2022). Airborne transmission of MPXV between animals in experimental settings has also been reported and MPXV was detected in upper respiratory samples, suggesting that interhuman transmission of MPXV via the airborne route may be possible. However, epidemiological observations do not support airborne transmission as the primary route of transmission (Riopelle et al., 2022). The virus can also cross the placenta, suggesting vertical transmission (Mbala et al., 2017; Cuerel et al., 2022). At least 12 pregnant women have been infected during the 2022 outbreak, but vertical transmission was not observed in any case (Khalil et al., 2020).

MPXV has also been detected in human semen (Antinori et al., 2022; Noe et al., 2022), and in archival testes tissue of crab-eating macaque (Liu et al., 2022), suggesting potential sexual transmission of the virus. Recent outbreak suggests that MSM subpopulation may also be at an increased risk (Kipkorir et al., 2022).

In addition, waning immunity against smallpox has been considered another potential risk factor for the disease (Rimoin et al., 2010). Evidence from early outbreaks in the 1980s showed that previous smallpox vaccination provided 85% protection against mpox (Rimoin et al., 2010). Most cases reported were among those born after vaccination ceased in 1980, and herd immunity has significantly decreased (Rimoin et al., 2010).

Evidence from the literature suggests that those who are immunocompromised due to HIV and other underlying conditions are at increased risk of severe mpox disease (Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC), 2022b) (Yinka-Ogunleye et al., 2019). A high proportion of patients with mpox in the 2022 outbreak had concurrent HIV infection and sexually transmitted infections (STI) (Fischer et al., 2022; Ghaffar and Shahnoor, 2022). Mpox patients with HIV infection were more likely to be hospitalized than those without HIV infection (Curran et al., 2022). However, the evidence on the reason for hospitalization is limited, and it is unknown if it reflects a more severe mpox illness (Curran et al., 2022).

Furthermore, co-infection with other conditions with rashes, such as a varicella-zoster virus (VZV), can occur (Hughes et al., 2021; Stephen et al., 2022). This herpesvirus causes chickenpox and shingles and is frequently misdiagnosed as mpox in regions where both diseases are endemic (Hoff et al., 2017; Hughes et al., 2021). Chickenpox is exclusive to humans and more common in younger age groups, and co-infection with mpox has been reported more commonly among children (Leung et al., 2019; Hughes et al., 2021).

DIAGNOSIS, SCREENING, PREVENTION, AND TREATMENT

DIAGNOSIS AND CASE DEFINITIONS

Electron microscopy, immunohistochemical detection of MPXV proteins, and detectable levels of anti-OPXV IgM antibody during the period of 4 to 56 days after rash onset can be used to diagnose MPXV infection, but all methods are not specific (Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC), 2022a). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC), 2022a), mpox cases should be confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or Next-Generation sequencing and isolation of MPXV in culture from a clinical specimen. The F3L, E9L, B6R and J2R genes are all target of qPCR in MPXV diagnosis (Li et al., 2010; Alakunle et al., 2020; Altindis et al., 2022; Cheema et al., 2022; Nakhaie et al., 2022). The suspected mpox cases are characterized by fulfilling one of the epidemiological criteria (within 21 days of illness onset), as outlined by CDC (Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC), 2022a).

SURVEILLANCE AND CONTACT TRACING

One of the crucial ways of controlling the spread of mpox is contact tracing (Harapan et al., 2022; Kalyar et al., 2022). Individuals exposed to MPXV should be monitored for 21 days checking mpox symptoms, and those with suspected or confirmed mpox cases should be isolated to avoid infecting others (Titanji et al., 2022). Velavan et al. predicted the mpox outbreak would not last provided that cases are well isolated through the contact tracing (Velavan and Meyer, 2022). Although much attention is given to human-human contact tracing, great efforts need to be put into animal-animal and animal-human contact tracing especially due to non-specificity of reservoir hosts for MPXV (Petersen et al., 2019a). Surveillance cannot be undermined in curtailing mpox as surveillance would provide more insight into the epidemiology of the disease (Riopelle et al., 2022). In Nigeria, the Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System (SORMAS) for mpox surveillance across portions of 8 states was implemented in November 2017 for the mpox outbreak. The use of the system increased the quantity of epidemiological data collected and the communication of aggregate case data (Mauldin et al., 2022).

VACCINE

Although there is no specific vaccine for MPXV (Hobson et al., 2021; Sah et al., 2022a), the smallpox vaccines have been reported to give 85% cross-immunity against MPXV due to shared antigenic features (Alakunle et al., 2020).

ACAM2000™ is a replication-competent vaccinia virus vaccine licensed by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2007 for smallpox prevention, and it is derived from a single clonal viral isolate from Dryvax (Gruber, 2022; Poland et al., 2022) which is a first-generation smallpox vaccine. As a second-generation attenuated vaccinia virus vaccine (Gessain et al., 2022), ACAM2000™ has been recommended as MPXV post-exposure prophylaxis (Aden et al., 2022; McCarthy, 2022). Although high level of protection against mpox in animal models has been recorded, the safety of ACAM2000™ in humans is still of great concern as cardiac complications, and extremely painful and uncomfortable cutaneous reaction at the injection site have been associated with the vaccine (Chandran et al., 2022). Therefore, the vaccine is no longer lice
