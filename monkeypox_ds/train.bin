monkeypox: a review of epidemiological modelling studies and how modelling has led to mechanistic insight abstract human monkeypox virus is a viral zoonosis that belongs to the orthopoxvirus genus of the poxviridae family, which presents with similar symptoms as those seen in human smallpox patients. mpox is an increasing concern globally, with over 80,000 cases in non-endemic countries as of december 2022. in this review, we provide a brief history and ecology of mpox, its basic virology, and the key differences in mpox viral fitness traits before and after 2022. we summarize and critique current knowledge from epidemiological mathematical models, within-host models, and between-host transmission models using the one health approach, where we distinguish between models that focus on immunity from vaccination, geography, climatic variables, as well as animal models. we report various epidemiological parameters, such as the reproduction number, r
0, in a condensed format to facilitate comparison between studies. we focus on how mathematical modelling studies have led to novel mechanistic insight into mpox transmission and pathogenesis. as mpox is predicted to lead to further infection peaks in many historically non-endemic countries, mathematical modelling studies of mpox can provide rapid actionable insights into viral dynamics to guide public health measures and mitigation strategies. introduction orthopoxviruses are a genus of viruses that include variola, vaccinia, cowpox, and monkeypox viruses. smallpox, a highly pathogenic orthopoxvirus, is estimated to have claimed the lives of over 300 million people worldwide but was successfully eradicated in 1977 through an international vaccine campaign led by the world health organization. mpox is endemic to multiple african countries, including benin, cameroon, the central african republic, the democratic republic of the congo, gabon, ivory coast, liberia, nigeria, the republic of the congo, sierra leone, and south sudan. historically, the transmission of mpox in non-endemic regions has been short-lived and contained within a specific geographic area. however, the increased prevalence of mpox in humans since the 1980s has been linked to a decrease in vaccine immunity and an increase in viral fitness traits, making it a significant emerging human threat. in 2022, the world health organization reported multiple international mpox outbreaks in 20 non-endemic european countries, as well as the united states of america, canada, mexico, and much of south america. from may to june 2022, these outbreaks resulted in a total of 780 cases. as of 28 july 2022, the centers for disease control and prevention reported 4907 confirmed cases in the united states, with the total cumulative cases in non-endemic countries exceeding 20,800. by december of 2022, the total reported cumulative cases in non-endemic countries surpassed 80,000. figure 1 is a heatmap of global cumulative case counts for the 2022 epidemic as of 17 november 2022. we also include a heatmap of case counts normalized by total country population, shown in figure 2. in june of 2022, the emergence of mpox in non-endemic countries led the who to declare the overall risk of further transmission as ‘moderate’ globally and ‘high’ in the european region. it was hypothesized that mpox mutated to find a new niche in tightly connected sexual networks. as such, mpox now presents a significant public health threat to non-endemic regions, with some countries, such as the united kingdom, responding by purchasing large amounts of smallpox vaccines for public distribution.figure 1.cumulative mpox cases for the 2022 epidemic from 1 january 2022, through 17 november 2022. heatmap constructed from publicly available who data.

first reported in 1959 in cynomolgus monkeys and was thus named ‘monkeypox’. the disease was found to have similar structural features as orthopoxviruses: rectangular with diameter 200–250 μm. it was also observed to present similarly to variola-vaccinia viruses and exhibited a similar serological relationship. further studies revealed that mpox led to the formation of intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions and could pass serially in rabbit skin. throughout the 1960s and 1970s, who continued to monitor both mpox and smallpox in non-human primates to determine if an animal reservoir existed. in the 1960s, four mpox outbreaks were recorded in animals with no recorded infections in humans. in 1966, an mpox outbreak occurred in a zoo and was believed to have been caused by two imported anteaters. the 1966 zoo outbreak had a particularly high mortality rate. despite containment procedures, mpox spread to nearby enclosures, resulting in 23 animal infections and a total of 11 deaths, including 6 out of 10 infected orangutans. transmission between humans the first human mpox case was reported in 1970 in a 9-month-old baby in the democratic republic of congo. a study of 155 mpox cases in west and central africa from 1970–1983 estimated only 20% of cases to spread from human-to-human contact, where human mpox cases were primarily suspected to occur from contact with monkeys and squirrels. the human-to-human transmission was noted to ‘stop spontaneously’, with attack rates suspected to be 15% amongst smallpox-unvaccinated households and 0.4% amongst vaccinated. these were noted to be comparably less than smallpox attack rates amongst the unvaccinated which ranged from 33% to 88%. a study conducted in zaire between 1980 and 1984 of 214 patients with human mpox found attack rates for household contacts of 7.2% amongst unvaccinated and 0.9% amongst vaccinated. in this study, 13% of cases were found amongst vaccinated individuals leading to the hypothesis that the immunity gained from smallpox vaccination was waning, and further raised a concern that the virus may later become endemic. the low attack rates of mpox, and the unchanging secondary attack rates throughout the 1970s through early 1980s amongst the unvaccinated, supported the decision from the global commission to cease the smallpox vaccination programme in central african countries where mpox was now considered endemic. multiple self-contained mpox outbreaks were documented through the early 2000s. of note, a major outbreak in nigeria began in september of 2017 and ultimately led to 228 suspected cases. human mpox infections in the 2017 nigeria outbreak were predominantly male, and the outbreak was ultimately contained. the 2003 mpox outbreak in the usa appeared to be particularly severe in children, where a fifth of paediatric patients developed serious complications resulting in intensive medical intervention, with half of paediatric patients admitted to the icu. for a detailed review of all pre-2018 human mpox outbreaks, we refer to ref.. the 2022 international emergence of human–human transmission of mpox in multiple non-endemic countries constitutes a significant shift in viral prevalence. pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and longitudinal within-host dynamics of mpox the incubation period of human mpox can range from 5 to 21 days, with a typical incubation period of 7–17 days, followed by a prodromal period of 1–4 days. clinical characteristics of mpox are similar to those of smallpox: enlarged lymph nodes and a rash period that lasts 14–28 days. distinct from smallpox, mpox often presents with cervical or inguinal lymphadenopathy, suggesting that the immune response to mpox differs from that of smallpox. a detailed list of clinical characteristics, including changes in mpox epidemiology as a function of time, is described in the article by wilson et al.. a study on non-human primates longitudinally tracked viral shedding and cytokines from both intrabronchial exposure and intravenous inoculation of mpox. through tracking mpox viral features over a 36-day window, they found that the time to mean day of lesion exposure increases as a function of decreasing mpox dosage. they further found peak viral load to vary significantly between nasal and oral swabs. recent clinical human studies in france and spain have longitudinally tracked cohorts of people over 14 and 57 days. these studies compare mpox viral load between hiv+ and hiv- individuals and find mpox cycle threshold values to decrease significantly for both categories of individuals, and further conclude transmission of mpox to primarily occur through direct body contact rather than through a respiratory route or bodily fluids. serological features that inform us about immune responses can also be used by within-host modelling studies to reveal mechanistic insight into viral traits as well as vaccine dynamics. interferon-gamma is a cytokine known to play a pivotal role in host defence against pathogens, and is often used to model within-host inflammatory responses and infer cellular-mediated immunity. immunity from smallpox vaccination has been shown to elicit ifng, cytotoxic t cell, and neutralizing protein responses in humans that can last over 20 years. the inflammatory cytokine ifng has been shown to play an important role in protection against mpox in mice, whereby inactivation of the ifng receptor led to increased sensitivity to mpox. earl et al. also report viral titres as a function of time in various major organs, where lungs were found to contain the highest pfu/g for all time points. they also track six cytokines, including ifng and il6, as a function of time after injection and find a strong ifng response in balb/c mice but not in other types of mice. interestingly, orthopoxvirus have been shown to suppress recognition of viruses by innate cells through suppressing ifn production. further, mpox has been found to suppress t-cell activation by triggering a state of t-cell non-responsiveness; thus, a within-host model of mpox should take into account cd4 and cd8 suppression dynamics. these longitudinal data serve as a useful starting point for a within-host modelling study of mpox and can be utilized to guide model predictive power and determine practical identifiability in estimated parameters. lum et al. provide an in-depth review of the clinical immune features of mpox. mpox cross-protective immunity from the smallpox vaccine is known to occur. for example, prairie dogs vaccinated with the smallpox vaccine and then challenged with mpox were found to mount a significant humoral response. further, vaccinated humans were found to mount strong cellular and humoral responses as shown in longitudinal data over a 32-day study period. however, longer-term studies find efficacy wanes at an approximate rate of 1.29%/yr. we refer to lum et al. for an in-depth review of mpox clinical immune features. in the next sections, we review epidemiological modelling efforts of population spread of mpox, distinguishing between human–human, animal–animal, animal–human, and human–animal scenarios. we further cover modelling studies incorporating climate variables, therapeutic strategies, contact tracing, and isolation measures. machine learning is emerging as a technology with demonstrated capability for early detection of mpox. however, we do not provide a detailed review of the application of machine learning to mpox; such work can be found in refs.. population-level epidemiological models sir/seir with no immunity compartmental modelling techniques have been used extensively to describe the population spread of infectious diseases. among infectious disease models, the most fundamental and classic model is the susceptible-infected-recovered compartmental model developed by kermack and mckendrick. in the sir model, the total population is divided into three subgroups based on the disease status: susceptible, infected, and recovered. s represents the susceptible population that has not yet but may be infected by the disease, i represents the infected population that can transmit the disease, and r represents the population recovered from the infected disease. two parameters are used in the classic sir model: the effective contact rate and the recovery rate. β affects the transition from s → i, and γ affects the transition from i → r, and the total population, n, is conserved through time n = s + i + r. an example schematic of the sir model is shown in figure 4a. the epidemiological model framework for mpox has been established over the past few decades, and many models capturing human–human, and animal–human interactions have been explored. jezek et al. constructed a stochastic model using the monte carlo method to simulate the chain of human-to-human transmission of mpox. the model has been validated and applied to understand the transmission potential of mpox in unvaccinated populations. bhunu and mushayabasa presented a basic sir compartmental model to examine the transmission dynamics of mpox between humans and non-humans, and betti et al. present a sir model with additional pair-formation dynamics to account for transmission via prolonged close contact between individuals. we summarize parameters determined by mpox epidemiological modelling studies in table 1. for the non-human population, mpox parameters are found to be: 2 yr−1 for the rate of recruitment for susceptibles, a natural death rate of 1.5 yr−1, the death rate due to mpox is given as 0.4 yr−1, and the rate of immunity is given as 0.6 yr−1. pre-2022, for the human population, mpox parameters were found to be: 0.029 yr−1 for recruitment rate of susceptibles, a natural death rate of 0.02 yr−1, the death rate due to mpox of 0.1–0.17 yr−1, and permanent immunity rate of 0.83–0.9 yr−1. the animal-only endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when r
0n > 1 and r
0h < 1. the endemic equilibrium, where mpox infections exist in both the human and non-human populations, was shown to be locally asymptotically stable when r
0h > 1, but close to 1. models with vaccination the sir model often oversimplifies complex disease transmission dynamics. for example, the sir model does not consider the incubation duration, defined as the span of time between when an individual is exposed to a disease and when that individual becomes infected. we refer to tolles and luong who highlight limitations of the traditional sir model, including that it results in often over-simplified assumptions about the population dynamics. thus, most epidemiological work involves sir-inspired models with more mathematical complexity to account for complex population dynamics. the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model has been widely used to study infectious disease dynamics. in the seir model, an exposed compartment is added to the fundamental sir model, representing individuals who are exposed but have not yet been contagious, such that they experience an incubation period. mitigation strategies such as vaccination can also be considered. for example, usman et al. developed an sveir model that accounts for a varied incubation period and individual vaccination status. they found that adequate vaccination and treatment policies could dramatically reduce the spread of mpox among humans. based on mpox parameters prior to year 2017, they conclude that an increase in vaccination control parameters leads to a decrease in the basic reproduction number. emeka et al. also incorporate a vaccine compartment in a population of mpox-susceptible individuals and generally find that mpox outbreaks do not occur in populations of vaccinated individuals. building on the work of usman and adamu, bankuru et al. introduced a simplified sir model of the mpox dynamics, providing closed-form formulas for equilibrium states of this disease dynamics, allowing for direct calculations of the semi-endemic equilibrium. they showed there exists a semi-endemic equilibrium in which there is no infection in the squirrel population, while the disease still persists in the human population. they found that the optimal vaccination rate amongst humans is about 0.04 vaccine/year, meaning that individuals should be advised to vaccinate approximately once every 25 years. they also found the optimal vaccination rate is about 10 times more sensitive to parameters related to animal hosts than to a corresponding parameter related to humans, thus concluding that more precise information about reservoir hosts is needed.figure 3.costs versus vaccination rate with a high rate of the effective human-to-human transmission. fully endemic equilibrium and semi-endemic equilibrium. reprinted by permission from peerj from ref.. copyright 2020. as countries such as the uk are purchasing large quantities of vaccines for public dissemination, given that vaccine efficacy has been found to drop at a rate of 1.29% per year, mathematical modelling studies such as that done by bankuru et al. can be used to inform vaccination rates, as well as which proportion of the population needs to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. another important factor explored by bankuru et al. is the cost of vaccination. where cost is defined in a game-theoretic sense, the cost of not vaccinating is given by the product of the cost of infection with the probability of becoming infected. in figure 3, we include plots of cost as a function of vaccination rate when the human–human transmission rate is high, where bankuru et al. find that the overall cost of vaccinating is much lower compared to not-vaccinating for most epidemic scenarios. a combination of historical data and epidemiological modelling was used to estimate the basic reproduction number, r
0, of mpox in the democratic republic of the congo during 1966–1984 to be between 1.46 and 2.17. mpox r
0 was thus significantly less than smallpox which had an estimated range of r
0 of 3.2–6.9. due to the lasting immunity from the smallpox vaccine, mpox was deemed not self-sustainable in human populations in the drc from 1980–1984. however, by the year 2011 estimates show that the immunity from smallpox vaccination against mpox had fallen to 60% in non-endemic countries. hence, mpox has long been hypothesized to have increasing potential to emerge as an epidemic in humans in historically non-endemic countries. epidemiological modelling studies on the 2022 global outbreak population-level human-to-human models of mpox throughout the 2022 epidemic have been largely based on sir and seir frameworks. these modelling studies consider public health mitigation strategies, contact tracing, and sexual mixing models. for reference, the current scenario of global cumulative mpox cases by country is shown in figure 1, and with cases normalized by country population shown in figure 2. we further include the current global trend as a function of time for 2022, as shown in figure 4b. we next go through current modelling literature on the 2022 epidemic, and how modelling is bringing further mechanistic insight into mpox dynamics.figure 4. schematic of basic sir model with standard incidence, similar as used to model mpox dynamics for the 2022 pandemic. global reported mpox cases as a function of weeks for the year 2022. data accessed from publicly available who data. the increase in cases from the 2022 mpox global outbreak has been shown to be strongly associated with close intimate sexual contact. for the 2022 epidemic, mpox spread has been predominantly transmitted between men who have sex with men, with one study of 528 diagnosed infections finding 98% of infected persons to be gay or bisexual males. data-driven individual-level and population-level modelling studies can be used to outline the importance of public health policies and various mitigation strategies. for example, the model presented by betti et al. presents a novel framework that includes pair formation to describe mpox transmission. they show their pair-formation model captures population trends in data with an estimated r
0 of 2.3, and they further predict the occurrence of future waves of infection. similarly, bragazzi et al. develop a seiqr model that includes the sexual behaviour of high-risk individuals and find that r
0 amongst the high-risk population to be ∼1.5, whereas amongst the low-risk population to be as low as 0.007. modelling has also been used to disentangle the many factors leading the decline of mpox in the 2022 outbreak. for example, through examining changes in sexual behavioural activity versus vaccination campaigns, studies have found the initial downturn in cases during the 2022 epidemic was largely due to changes in sexual behaviour. network models have also demonstrated utility towards understanding mpox transmission dynamics. bisanzio et al. utilize a recently developed individual-based modelling framework whereby they simulate the spread of mpox in a network of 50 million susceptible individuals distributed across n cells to represent a population density characteristic of a typical european country of land mass similar to france or spain. with spread amongst the population driven by an seir model, they predict mpox outbreaks lasting 23–37 weeks where mitigation strategies such as contact tracing with isolation followed by vaccination could reduce the median duration of a mpox outbreak by as much as 75%. another network model by van dijck et al. explores the ramifications of undiagnosed mpox cases and predict that if 10% of mpox contacts abstain from sexual activity, this could result in a 35% reduction in cases. another contact tracing study on the transmission dynamics in the uk predicted the epidemic peak to occur in early july of 2022, and further found that a significant number of cases were caused by pre-symptomatic transmission and determined a mean incubation period of 8.5 days. compartmental and game-theoretic modelling, as well as modelling infection curves with comparably simple logistic functions, has also proven to be beneficial towards revealing mpox population dynamics and the consequences of various mitigation strategies. mingione et al. apply the generalized logistic curve to country-wide data from the top 10 non-endemic countries experiencing mpox outbreaks and find agreement with the literature that containment of the outbreak is feasible over the short term if mitigation strategies are employed. building on previous work similar to ref., augsburger et al. employ an sveir-based model to the 2022 global pandemic and further explore vaccination in a game-theoretic framework where individuals consider cost and benefits to vaccination. they find without vaccination mpox prevalence is predicted to be approximately 3.5 cases per 104 individuals, while with optimal voluntary vaccination, prevalence is predicted to be approximately 0.5 cases per 104 individuals. thus, vaccination is predicted to be a strong mitigative factor in reducing mpox prevalence and minimizing the chances of mpox becoming endemic is historically non-endemic countries. savinkina et al. employ an seir-based model, utilizing previously published assumptions on low-risk and high-risk population-level reproduction numbers, and simulate the spread of mpox on college campuses. in their hypothetical analysis, they find the absence of mitigation leads to an 83% chance of sustained transmission. the population modelling studies of the 2022 global outbreak all agree, based on current data on mpox trends, that the outbreaks occurring in non-endemic countries are generally under control and on a declining trend. this is of course supported by the current global trend in cases; a histogram of global case counts up to 29 november 2022 is shown in figure 4b. a summary of 2022 mpox mathematical modelling population parameters is provided in table 1. epidemiological modelling studies are important for policy decision-makers when deciding which mitigation strategy or control measures to employ. predictive modelling for future mpox peaks will be important in aiding policy decision-makers. for example, modelling techniques on mpox have been developed to estimate the true number of unreported cases, and further, have shown promise to accurately predict infection cycles. modelling studies clearly highlight the important of mitigation strategies. for example, vaccination campaigns should be organized to reduce population infectivity and further reduce the probability of allowing a more virulent and transmissive mpox strain to emerge. yuan et al. consider an seir model whereby the population is divided into high and low risk and focus their study on mass gathering scenarios. they find that a broad vaccination campaign is less effective in curbing the spread of mpox than compared to contact tracing, isolation, and vaccination of close contacts. they further posit that the ring vaccination strategy may be inadequate in preventing an outbreak from occurring; however, it does still result in fewer case counts. they follow up their work with a study to consider the mpox threat to the low-risk population if viral transmissibility increases. they conclude that isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine are key mitigation strategies to prevent infection in the event of increased viral transmission into low-risk populations. predictive modelling for future mpox peaks can be an important factor in aiding policy decision-makers. for example, based on canadian mpox trends, there are predicted to be further peaks occurring on an approximately annual basis. as noted, the 2022-mpox strain is predominantly spreading through close intimate contacts. however, orthopoxviruses, such as smallpox, are known to transmit via a respiratory route. currently, a respiratory transmission mode is not found to play a major role in the 2022 outbreak. thus, modelling studies, such as bottleneck studies, that aim to predict mutation lineages and probabilities of mutant transmission, can play an important role in predicting the potential severity of future mpox mutants. the concern that mpox could mutate to find a respiratory transmission route is warranted. the cost and benefit of mitigation strategies, including the details of how they can be disseminated to the public, can be readily explored through modelling studies to aid public health campaigns should the virus emerge with a more infectious mutant. immunity decline hypothesis the recent 2022 emergence and outbreaks of mpox are still under investigation. one hypothesis for the increase in cases relates to the decline in population cross-immunity provided by the smallpox vaccine. in 1980, the who declared the eradication of smallpox. soon afterwards, routine smallpox immunization ended worldwide. smallpox vaccine has proven to induce humoral and cell-mediated responses against orthopoxviruses, creating a heterotypic immunity composed of a wide array of antigen receptors and estimated to have an efficacy of 85% in preventing mpox infection in humans. thus, it has been suggested that younger generations not vaccinated against smallpox are vulnerable to mpox infection. this section will discuss the current evidence from mathematical models testing the declining immunity from vaccination in increasing susceptibility to mpox. data from the democratic republic of the congo revealed that individuals born before the official vaccination cessation had a 5.21-fold lower risk of mpox infection than unvaccinated persons. nguyen et al. modelled the declining immunity in nigeria, accounting for individual-level declining immunity at a rate of 1.29% per year, as well as country-wide declining immunity using weighted regional estimates of smallpox vaccination coverage. they found the increase in unvaccinated and immunologically naive population, and together with the decline from 85% to 23.1% in efficacy from cross-immunity protection provided by smallpox vaccination, and that the overall population immunity was estimated to be only 2.2% as of 2018. shown in figure 5a, we include an example of their findings.figure 5. visualization of the relationship between smallpox vaccination and cross-immunity conferred to mpox virus rates at a population and individual level in nigeria from 1970 to 2018. reprinted by permission from centers for disease control and prevention from ref.. copyright 2021. predicted change of the reproduction number r for mpx as a function of immunity in a population to orthopoxvirus species. blue circles show a scenario where the vaccination percentage is high, most of the population presents high-level cross-immunity against orthopoxvirus species, and the mpox r value is low. yellow circles show the scenario where vaccination and cross-immunity rates are low, and mpox r-value increases to >2.5. reprinted by permission from the world health organization from ref.. copyright 2020. the declining immunity from vaccination to smallpox represents an epidemiological threat by increasing the mpox reproduction number. the basic reproduction number, r0, of any infectious disease is dynamic and depends on many variables, including characteristics of the pathogen characteristics and the host. grant et al. modelled this relationship with data from the drc. they determine an mpox reproduction number, r.
r is given by r = r
0, where ϵ represents the vaccine efficacy, and p the vaccination coverage. given a current immunity estimate, they determine r could be higher than 2.5. we include a plot of their results for r as a function immunity in figure 5b. the increase in attack rate over time may be evidence for the immunity decline hypothesis as well. mpox household attack rates amongst the unvaccinated and vaccinated were reported as 15% and 0.4%, respectively, in 1985. the 2013 outbreak in the drc, which represented a 600-fold increase in annual infections, was found to have a household attack rate of 50%, where many people who contracted mpox were previous smallpox vaccine recipients. the loss of immunity hypothesis is not mutually exclusive from other re-emergence theories, such as the increased exposure to wildlife, reservoir expansion, globalization, and mutations to mpox fitness traits. these factors represent critical barriers to consider for mpox spillover opportunity. an increase in the mpox immune-naive population and the risk of exposure create a niche for continued mpox animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission, longer chains of infection, and thus an opportunity for mutation in mpox viral transmission traits. pre-2022, human-to-human transmission chains have been relatively short-lived, and stochastic models performed in the 1980s based on historical data found mpox to have a low probability to be established in human populations. however, more recent models have shown that sustained human-to-human transmissions could favour pathogen evolution, creating a potential existence of semi-endemic or fully endemic equilibrium. a clustered epidemiological differential model developed by ali et al. considered human behavioural dynamics such as vaccination and drug hesitancy, cooperation, and mobility rate and showed how opination dynamics have a tremendous impact on fatality rates. furthermore, models on voluntary vaccination have shown the potential control of mpox outbreaks in a semi-endemic equilibrium but not in a fully endemic one. in an endemic equilibrium scenario, deterministic compartmental models showed that isolation of infected individuals, in combination with adequate treatment and vaccination, plays an essential role in the control and eradication of mpox. modelling efforts show vaccination remains a high-potential primary mpox mitigation strategy and should continue to be prioritized in endemic regions. however, to achieve effective mpox management, a combination of countermeasures needs to be considered. novel mpox-specific vaccines, treatments, and prophylaxis public health measures are all under development to mitigate mpox spread. effect of reservoirs and wildlife control measures a report by the who in 1968 concluded that mpox transmission between monkeys is ‘infrequent’ and that most likely another animal reservoir existed. a definitive mpox virus reservoir host is still unknown and under study. currently, giant-pouched rats, rope squirrels, and african dormice are posited as the most likely candidates. throughout the 1980s, the animal–animal spread was found with particular prevalence in squirrels of the funisciurus anerythrus species, where it was shown they sustain mpox viral transmission in areas near human settlements. squirrel mpox-related death rates and recovery rates were later found to be approximately 17.5 and 12 days, respectively. during the 2022 global mpox outbreak, it was discovered that human-to-dog transmission is possible, thus raising concerns about further dog-to-dog and dog-to-human transmission. culling, the reduction in wild animal populations through selective slaughter, has been employed as a method for wildlife reservoir management and to mitigate the potential of further animal-to-human transmission. for example, culling has been employed recently during the sars-cov-2 pandemic to mitigate further animal-to-animal transmission amongst farmed minks. culling to prevent further mpox spread has been explored through transmission modelling approaches, where it has been found to be ineffective and can lead to the counter-productive outcome of increasing mpox infection. this is because culling results in the sudden removal of mature animals with immunity replaced with juvenile, more susceptible animals, thus increasing the probability of outbreaks. climatic variables influencing mpox transmission: a one health approach the one health approach aims to recognize the strong linkage between the health of humans, animals, plants, and the environment, to develop integrated and sustainable solutions. given the interconnected coexistence between humans, animals, and the environment, mpox emergence in the context of climate change represents a one health challenge. from a one health perspective, we present current evidence on mathematical modelling connecting climate change impacts on the environment, animals, and humans, to mpox dynamics. climate change has altered human–environment systems. the emergence and re-emergence of many infectious diseases are projected to increase due to the negative impact of climate change. interactions between the three factors embodied in the epidemiological triangle: the virus, the human, and the reservoir, have been found to contribute to mpox emergence and expansion. in addition to the decrease in herd immunity caused by the cessation of smallpox vaccination, climatic variables and human behaviour have created an ideal niche for mpox transmission. in this section, we discuss the current model-based evidence for mpox transmission, emphasizing the influence of climate factors. the impact on human health from climate change is an emerging topic. there is a consensus on increased adverse climate-related health outcomes such as food insecurity, heath-related mortality and morbidity, mental health damage, or injuries. impacts on health can include the impairment of the immune system due to direct or indirect effects of climate change. there has been significant scientific interest in mpox spread within endemic african countries with particular attention to mpox biogeographic barriers. environmental conditions can define the spread and durability of pathogens outside their hosts. survival models have shown that orthopoxviruses are high-virulence high-survival pathogens, which implies high durability outside their host. seasonal patterns of mpox outbreaks have been observed during the fall season and linked to deforestation and flooding. historical evidence suggests that dense and humid lowland tropical forests ecotones are the most favourable ecosystem for zoonotic transmission of mpox. prior to the 2022 outbreak, mathematical models concluded that continued mpox human–human population spread required continued zoonotic reservoir exposure to maintain chains of transmission. therefore, much attention has been paid to mpox reservoirs; however, there is no clear consensus on the natural or definitive reservoir as of the time of writing. it is known that environmental conditions can affect the transmission of mpox between animals. having an unknown primary reservoir for mpox limits a model’s accuracy in the prediction of the impact of climate variables on the animal–animal and animal–human dynamics. multivariate analyses of historical data have demonstrated that mpox can co-occur on several species in an unanticipated manner. additionally, ecological niche modelling techniques have been used to model the climate and spatial distribution of mpox, where these modelling studies emphasized the critical role of ecosystem variation on reservoir distribution.figure 6. two-dimensional representation of ecological niche models developed for two

publishing from ref.. copyright 2018. understanding mpox spatial ecology is essential to predict future outbreaks under climate change conditions. spatial and probabilistic models have been used to study mpox occurrence, particularly in africa. including climatic variables has been demonstrated to be critical in the spatial analysis of mpox at a local scale and regional scale. climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation seasonality are reservoir species predictors, meaning that a small change in those variables could also change the reservoir dynamics and thus animal–human transmission probability. furthermore, climatic and ecosystem variables can increase habitat suitability for potential mpox reservoirs and, by extension, more frequent wildlife–human contact. other extreme weather events, such as droughts, can force carrying mpox species to move closer to human settlements. future research predicting shifts in reservoir species should also focus on how this dynamic is affected by environmental changes. we propose that models should include the viral dynamic considerations of interrupting or increasing wildlife–human interaction frequency under climate change scenarios. wastewater-based epidemiology to monitor mpox levels wastewater-based epidemiology is a population-level biomarker surveillance method to analyse wastewater for either chemicals or pathogens. wbe has been shown to be able to estimate mpox population trends through time; however, key gaps in our understanding of the application of wbe to mpox have been highlighted, namely, the current lack of a 100% inclusive wbe methodology and limits cross-reactivity with non-targeted species. towards applying wbe to mpox, chen and bibby developed a monte carlo approach to estimate the probability of detecting mpox dna in wastewater. they determine that united states wastewater treatment plants may be able to detect 7 infections out of 100,000 people based on previously reported daily shedding rates. towards a within-host model for mpox the goal of within-host modelling is to represent the complex physiological processes of a disease, or therapeutic, within the body with mathematical models. within-host mathematical models are developed under biological principles and then fit longitudinal serological data to estimate various aspects of physiological dynamical outcomes. modelling of in-host pathogen dynamics has proven critical towards furthering our understanding of hiv, hcv, hbv, hsv, influenza, and sars-cov-2 as well as aiding the development of vaccine therapies. following the development and fitting of a model to serological data, structural and practical identifiability methods are then employed to assess model reproducibility and reliability. within-host models have been used extensively to estimate properties of disease dynamics, thus contributing to our understanding of the disease progression at the within-host scale. at the time of writing, there is a noticeable lack of within-host mechanistic modelling studies of mpox, with few within-host studies for any orthopoxvirus. the work of ogunjimi et al., who model the cd4 trajectories of human chickenpox, to the best of our knowledge, is the only published orthopoxvirus within-host modelling work. the mpox longitudinal clinical studies outlined in section 3 provides an overview of current knowledge of mpox serological parameters required to fit to a typical within-host model and should serve as a strong starting point for such a study. future directions and concluding thoughts mathematical modelling provides a cost-effective and non-invasive methodology for gaining actionable insights into viral dynamics and therapeutic responses at the population and within-host levels. at the within-host level, mathematical modelling utilizes serology-based diagnostics to understand disease transmission dynamics, including viral reproduction numbers, viral load clearance, and cell recovery, to understand the timescales of disease transmission. however, such studies on mpox are currently limited. at the population level, mathematical modelling leverages population metrics, such as contact tracing data, cumulative case counts, and wastewater surveillance, to predict outbreak characteristics such as recovery rates, transmission, virulence, and reproduction numbers. although the current mpox epidemic case counts are declining, models predict future waves to occur annually. therefore, modelling efforts can assist in the allocation of public health resources to mitigate the future spread of infection, such as identifying when and whom to target in vaccine or education campaigns. the burden of human infectious disease remains high in many countries, with recent outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging pathogens referred to as the ‘new era of infectious disease’. climate change is causing significant changes in natural ecosystems worldwide. more than half of infectious diseases affecting human populations having been aggravated by climate hazards through pathways such as bringing pathogens closer to people or causing favourable changes to viral fitness traits. mathematical models of infectious diseases that consider climatic variables, such as accomplished for diseases such as influenza virus, west nile virus, sars-cov2, and malaria, have demonstrated utility for policymakers in planning public health prevention and responses strategies. this review revealed that the practice of including climatic variables in the mathematical modelling of mpox still needs further exploration. for example, current modelling evidence suggests that climate variables can significantly impact mpox transmission and pathogenesis by affecting the reservoir–human contact environment. therefore, it is crucial to consider climatic variables at the local, regional, and global scales in future mpox mathematical modelling studies to better understand its complex dynamics with potential reservoirs and potential impacts on human populations. the emergence of mpox as a global threat in 2022 has resulted in over 80,000 cases in non-endemic countries as of 17 november 2022. as mpox has gained global attention, it is becoming increasingly important to conduct higher resolution studies that report regular case counts and longitudinal serological measures, such as iggs, and cd4/cd8 responses, which can be utilized in mathematical modelling approaches to gain deeper insight into viral dynamics and predictive power. an interdisciplinary work between clinicians and mathematicians can better inform timescales of clinical data acquisition to gain the optimal information on disease dynamics from limited data sets. to date, no within-host modelling studies of mpox have been carried out to our knowledge. efforts to quantify an immunological correlation of protection in humans against mpox have been reported. however, a robust correlate of protection against the 2022 strain still needs to be discovered. mathematical approaches can leverage serological studies to correlate humoral and cellular longitudinal responses with case severity or vaccine efficacy, similar to what has been done for sars-cov-2. it is also important to understand differences in within-host dynamics amongst cohorts containing various comorbidities, notably high-risk individuals co-infected with syphilis or hiv. longitudinal studies working to understand the risks of vaccination in these vulnerable populations need to be included. as has become evident throughout the sars-cov-2 pandemic, many long-term consequences of sars-cov-2 can present as neurological or psychiatric, cardiovascular, and various immunological dysfunctions. longitudinal studies to identify and understand the extent of these potential long-term consequences for moderate and severe mpox cases will become increasingly important. mathematical modelling can help predict the proportion of individuals expected to suffer from long-term consequences of mpox infection and inform public health policy decisions.
virology, epidemiology, transmissions, diagnostic tests, prophylaxis and treatments of human mpox: saudi arabia perspective abstract mpox is a highly contagious viral disease that can be transmitted from animal-to-human or human-to-human through intimate contact, mpox is caused by the monkeypox virus, which is an enveloped double-stranded dna that belongs to the genus orthopoxvirus, poxviridae family, and subfamily chordopoxvirinae. mpox cases were previously only reported in west and central africa, however in recent times non-endemic countries including saudi arabia also reported confirmed mpox cases. the first laboratory-confirmed human mpox case in sa was reported on 14 july 2022, since then a number of confirmed mpox cases have been reported by who in sa. these confirmed mpox cases in sa were observed among individuals with a history of visiting european union countries. sa is not only at risk of importation of mpox cases owing to travel to such countries, but also there are various other risk factors including geographic proximity to the african continent, trade in exotic animals, and massive inflow of tourists. therefore, government health authorities of sa should continue to collaborate with various international health organizations including who to prevent, manage or monitor potential health risks at most of the entry points in sa including highways, seaports, and airports by ensuring adherence to hygiene protocols, vaccinations, and health screenings. there are a range of diagnostic tests are currently available that can be used in sa to confirm mpox infections, including real-time pcr, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, serological testing, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-crispr-associated protein -based systems, whole-genome sequencing, electron microscopy, and virus isolation and culture. there is no approved treatment specifically for mpox, however multiple approved antiviral agents for smallpox treatment were found to be useful in mpox treatment and in the management of mpox outbreaks, such as- trifluridine, brincidofovir, tecovirimat, and cidofovir. the aim of this review is to provide valuable insights regarding virology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, transmissions, clinical presentation, diagnostic tests, prophylactic measures and therapeutic options of mpox from sa perspective. moreover, a side-by-side discussion on the global trend and scenarios of mpox has been provided for comparison and further improvement in measures against mpox in sa. introduction mpox is a viral infectious disease caused by the mpox virus, which is an enveloped double-stranded dna virus that belongs to the poxviridae family of the genus orthopoxvirus. mpxv infects a range of animals including non-human primates, such as monkeys, dogs, squirrels, rodents, and others. in 1958, mpox was first identified in monkeys reserved for research in an animal facility in denmark. humans are accidental hosts of mpxv and the first human mpox case was documented in the democratic republic of the congo in 1970. mpox cases were initially common in the african countries including drc, sierra leone, liberia, central african republic, south sudan, gabon, nigeria, and cameroon. however, an increased number of human cases of mpox was reported in all 5 continents in 2022. both u.s. centers for disease control and prevention and world health organization have classified mpox as an emerging disease because of its rapid dissemination and high infectivity. in addition, between july 2022 and may 2023, who declared mpox as a public health emergency of international concern. from 1 january 2022 to 11 october 2024, the who has already reported 106,310 laboratory-confirmed mpox cases and 234 deaths in 123 countries. over the past four decades, multiple factors have contributed in the increased incidences of the mpox outbreak. smallpox immunization program discontinuance is one such factor. it has been demonstrated that the smallpox vaccine can provide up to around 85% effectiveness in preventing mpox. extensive intake of animal meat as a protein source particularly in the civil war and poverty-stricken regions, where the animal is a potential reservoir of mpxv. other factors that are playing a role in increasing mpox cases include elevated exposure to reservoir animals, environmental and ecological conditions, the ease of transboundary travel, and the growing human population worldwide. interestingly, various meteorological factors also play a major role in mpox cases, where temperature is found to be positively linked with mpox cases and wind speed is negatively linked. there is also a link between mpox cases and obesity, where increased occurrence of mpox has been observed in obese individuals. mpox was previously only reported in west and central africa, however in recent times non-endemic countries also reported confirmed mpox cases including the saudi arabia and its neighboring countries. the first laboratory-confirmed human mpox case in sa was reported on 14 july 2022 and a total of 8 confirmed mpox cases were reported by who as of 30 june 2024. in sa, confirmed mpox cases were observed among individuals with a history of visiting european union countries. sa is not only at risk of importation of mpox cases owing to travel to such countries, but also there are various other risk factors including geographic proximity to the african continent, trade in exotic animals, and massive inflow of tourists. moreover, unlike earlier outbreaks, it has been observed that there is also a change in the nature of mpox epidemiology and an increased number of older and middle-aged adults are being affected by this infectious disease. since who has declared mpox as a health emergency, therefore the ministry of health in sa has developed some guidelines and preventive measures to prevent the spread and transmission of mpxv including targeted use of the 2nd or 3rd-generation mpox or smallpox vaccines, the use of typical polymerase chain reaction techniques, timely screening with nucleic acid amplification testing, and tracing and isolating mpox affected individuals. this review aims to provide valuable insights regarding virology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, transmissions, clinical presentation, diagnostic tests, prophylactic measures and therapeutic options of mpox from sa perspective. moreover, a side-by-side discussion on the global trend and scenarios of mpox have been provided for comparison and further improvement in measures against mpox in sa. virology of mpxv classification mpxv is an enveloped double-stranded dna that belongs to the genus orthopoxvirus, poxviridae family, and subfamily chordopoxvirinae. mpxv is closely related to cowpox virus, vaccinia virus, and variola virus. clade i or congo basin clade and clade ii or west african clade are the 2 distinct mpxv phylogenetic clades. there are 2 subclasses of clade ii including clade iia and clade iib. in general, the genomic sequences of clade i and clade ii derived mpxv strains show an overall 99% identity of nucleotides within the same region, while 95% nucleic acid identity across different geographical clusters. genomic organization and morphology of mpxv the genome of mpxv is around 197,000 kb and possesses over 190 open reading frames, with inverted terminal repeats flanking the terminal ends. a minimum of 90 orfs are essential for the poxvirus replication and morphogenesis. a number of non-essential orfs are supposed to have a significant contribution in the alterations in poxvirus host tropism, pathogenesis, and immunomodulation, while the functions of most of the orfs are yet to be characterized. the virions of mpxv have an average size of 280 nm × 220 nm and they are either oval or barrel-shaped. a unique dumbbell-shaped nucleoprotein core is present in poxvirus mature particles and they contain a large genome composed of double-stranded linear dna. moreover, mpxv virions possess virus-encoded dna-dependent rna polymerases and more than 30 viral structural and membrane proteins. essential orthopoxvirus genes are found in the central portion of the mpxv genome. nonetheless, as compared to the genomes of other opvs, a small number of orfs are either truncated or lost in the genome of mpxv. multiple disrupted orfs encoding genes associated with immune evasion have been reported in clade ii, where these mutations might be responsible for the lesser virulence of clade ii in comparison with clade i. the extracellular enveloped virus and intracellular mature virus are the 2 different infectious mpxv forms. these infectious forms are also different in terms of cell-infecting mechanisms and surface glycoproteins. imv is released during cell lysis, while eev is accountable for early dispersal. the major structural difference between eev and imv is that the additional outermost membrane layer is not present in imv. there is also a difference in the quantities of viral proteins incorporated into the 2 types of virions. mpxv replicates through a complex process, however it is generally thought to be similar to that of other opvs. the entry receptors of mpxv are yet to be fully discovered. nonetheless, it is supposed that the entry of mpxv is reliant on host cell type as well as viral strain as well as involves many surface receptors including chondroitin sulfate or heparan sulfate. epidemiology of mpxv global epidemiology during the time of initial identification, 282 human cases were reported in zaire between 1980 and 1985. the age range of the affected individuals was from 1 month to 69 years, where 90% of them were under 15 years of age. however, there was an 11% mortality rate in unvaccinated patients along with an increased rate in children, while no death was reported in vaccinated individuals. a study also reported an increased case fatality rate among the young children as compared to general population. immunization against smallpox typically provides protection against mpox, however smallpox eradication and consequent reduction in the vaccination campaign hindered the cross-protective immunity against mpox. lack of proper mpxv reporting from rural africa leads to an underestimated threatening potential of mpxv. following an under-reported period of 39 years in nigeria’s bayelsa state, mpxv re-emerged in 2017, which was then supposedly exported to israel and other countries through travelers. subsequently, the number of mpox cases were increased in 2018 and 2019. a number of factors played a role in the mpxv outbreak outside africa including direct contact with infected monkeys, travelling, shipping, and importation, or susceptible populations with a risk of contracting mpox. moreover, smallpox vaccine cessation might also have contributed in increased mpxv transmission from human-to-human. mpxv outbreaks outside africa indicate the global connection of mpox infection. thus, measures are needed to promote diagnosis and monitoring to find out the fluctuating epidemiology of mpox. mpox not only affected africa, but also developed countries. in the u.s., two mpox cases were observed the persons who returned from nigeria to texas in july 2021. on may 6, 2022, a british man was also found to be mpox infected, after his visit to nigeria. as of september 24, 2024, more than 106 thousand confirmed cases, including in europe and north america, have been reported. mpox is commonly detected in western and central africa; however mpox cases have been reported in developed countries as well, which indicates that mpxv is spreading globally. according to who definitions, a suspected case is someone who is a contact of a confirmed or probable mpox case in the 21 days before the onset of symptoms or signs including fatigue, profound weakness, back pain, myalgia, headache, acute onset of fever. on the other hand, a probable case is someone who exhibits lymphadenopathy, mucosal lesions, unexplained acute skin rash, and has a positive test result for orthopoxviral infection, had several and/or casual sexual partners in the 3 weeks before onset of symptoms, and has an epidemiological link to a confirmed or probable case of mpox in the 21 days before onset of symptoms. a confirmed mpox case requires laboratory-confirmed mpox virus by detection of unique mpox dna sequences through real-time pcr and/or sequencing. all mpxv-infected cases took place because of travelling to africa or through animal shipping. in the u.s. alone, around 29,980 probable and confirmed cases and 80 mortalities have been reported. collectively, these findings suggest that mpox is a global threat, which further indicates the necessity of developing a strategic plan to avert mpox from becoming a pandemic. saudi arabia epidemiology limited data is available regarding mpox epidemiology in sa. assiri et al. investigated the continued mpox occurrence in sa after removal of public health emergency of mpox by who. the researchers investigated 381 cases of mpox in sa from may to september 2023. they found that 91.1% of the mpox-affected individuals are males with an average age of 32.4 years. out of 381 individuals, 379 individuals were not associated with secondary cases, 277 individuals refused engagement in extra-marital sex, and 356 of them did not report travelling. headache was experienced by 314 individuals, while fever was present in 371 cases. in terms of lesions, the most commonly affected areas include the mouth, face, genitals, and palms and soles. all of the genotyped samples were found to be subclade iib. in a different study at king saud medical city, dar et al. provided a detailed report of 16 confirmed mpox cases detected in riyadh, sa between june and september 2023. the diagnosis and management of confirmed and suspected cases were carried out by following guidelines developed by saudi public health authority, among these 16 laboratory-confirmed cases, 2 were saudi, 9 pakistani, 2 bangladeshi, 2 indian and one yemini. in addition, 14 out of 16 affected individuals are migrant workers in sa for over 1 year. the average age of the confirmed individuals was 33.9 years and 15 of them were males. no mortality or substantial complications were reported among the patients. pathogenesis of mpxv mpox is a highly contagious disease that can be transmitted from animal-to-human or human-to-human through close contact of any kind, which is regarded as the first step in the pathogenesis and pathogenicity of mpxv. there are several ways through which mpxv can be transmitted from person to person. different modes of transmission have been further discussed in the “transmission of mpxv” section. the entry of mpxv particles into host cells is the first step of viral pathogenesis in humans. a number of studies have been carried out to elucidate the interaction between mpxv and response of host cells, which suggests significant genetic diversity in the clade-specific genes across clade i and ii. indeed, this variation plays a role in the pathogenicity showed by these entities. mpxv genome is composed of several genes that are responsible for encoding host-response modifier proteins. mpox inhibitor of complement enzymes are considered as the virulence factors of mpxv. it has been observed that the mopice protein has a significant contribution in elevating pathogenicity in the case of clade i, while clade ii is lacking this protein. in the human body, mpxv can be introduced through various routes, such as intradermal routes, respiratory routes, or during sexual intercourse. on august 17, 2024, the public health authority released a statement that no clade i case has been detected in sa. the mpxv multiplies at the site of inoculation and then spreads into blood, lymph nodes, bone marrow, spleen, and tonsils, which eventually results in primary viremia and mpxv transportation into skin and testes. it has been revealed by in vivo studies that the primary sites of mpxv replication include lymphoid tissues in the throat and neck. following this primary mpxv replication, it further infects the liver and spleen. mpxv also infects langerhans cells, dendrites, and macrophages, which eventually results in inflammation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts. mpxv enters or invades the host cells either through macropinocytosis or a fusion mechanism. indeed, the mpxv entry and release mechanisms are complicated owing to the co-occurrence of two different viral forms including imv and eev, which are enclosed by diverse lipid bilayers and show characteristic surface proteins. transmission of mpxv some primates and rodents in central africa serve as the natural mpox hosts. early mpxv infections took place owing to contact with infected animals, such as consumption of undercooked meat or exposure to tissues, body fluids, and mucous membranes. in addition, mpxv transmission can take place via bites or scratches from infected animals. direct contact with respiratory droplets from infected persons is thought to be responsible for mpxv human-to-human transmission. moreover, vertical transmission of mpxv can take place from infected mothers to their infants. unlike previous mpox outbreaks, the recent outbreak was the major reported mpox outbreak outside of africa. previously, mpxv infection was only observed following traveling to mpox-affected counties or after contact with infected animals. nonetheless, most of the confirmed mpox cases of the current outbreak are not linked with travelling or direct contact with infected animals, but rather linked with sexual intercourse between individuals. furthermore, it was observed that most of the mpox cases were detected in bisexual or homosexual males. it has also been reported that 98% of the mpox cases were observed among bisexual or homosexual males and 41% of them had co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus. moreover, 73% of the lesions were observed in the genital and anal regions. substantial challenges for accurate diagnosis are faced because of this prolonged incubation period, which can further result in further mpxv transmission, disease progression, and delayed medical attention. clinical presentation mpox infections can widely vary ranging from self-limiting and mild illness to a severe form of the disease in immunocompromised individuals with life-threatening conditions. the average mpxv incubation period ranges from 2 days to 3 weeks. on the other hand, the average incubation period during the clade iib outbreak was found to range from 7-10 days. after an asymptomatic incubation period and before the appearance of a rash, mpox patients usually have prodromal symptoms for 1-5 days including headache, malaise, myalgias, lymphadenopathy, and fever. nonetheless, the timing of prodromal symptoms was found to be variable during the 2022 clade iib outbreak, which arose after, before, or during the occurrence of the rash or other presenting symptoms. painful skin lesion is the most common mpox clinical feature that consistently advances through four distinct stages over two to four weeks. typically, lesions start as macules and develop into pustules, vesicles, and papules, which desquamate and crust in the final stage. individuals with mpox remain infectious from the onset of clinical symptoms till all skin lesions are re-epithelialized, which usually takes up to four weeks. mpox rash typically takes place in a centrifugal distribution, where lesions are observed in limbs, trunk, and face. nonetheless, in the recent global outbreak, mpxv transmission predominantly occurred through sexual contact, which often resulted in anogenital and genital as well as oral and perioral lesions, along with painful mucosal lesions at any site, limited lesions, and nonuniform development of lesions. other complications including ocular disease, urethritis, pharyngitis, and proctitis were also observed in mpox individuals. in addition, less than 5% of mpox individuals show mucosal symptoms without skin lesions or a single skin lesion without other symptoms. in healthcare workers, localized single lesions were reported at the site of a needle-stick injury. mpox scenario in saudi arabia in sa, the first laboratory-confirmed human mpox case was reported on 14 july 2022 in riyadh and a total of 8 confirmed cases as of 30 june 2024. indeed, preventive measures are essential to prevent the mpxv transmission, which will further prevent an upcoming pandemic. in the beginning, there were no explicit guidelines for monitoring and regulating the transmission of mpxv in sa. however, subsequently the saudi arabian moh developed guidelines and implemented measures to control and monitor mpxv transmission in sa. saudi arabian moh contributed significantly in implementing and coordinating steps to regulate the covid-19 pandemic in sa through international collaborations, vaccination campaigns, public communication, resource allocation, policy decisions, and influential leadership, which further resulted in decreased severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission and eventually protected public health. in a similar manner, saudi arabian moh also has taken measures to control the spread of mpxv. if there is any suspected or confirmed mpox case, it is more likely that moh will take various preventive measures including contact tracing, isolation of the infected individuals, and monitoring of healthcare workers who might have come into the contact of mpxv. moh has also conducted various public awareness campaigns to raise public awareness regarding the mpox signs and symptoms in order to prevent mpox transmission. moreover, moh has also considered offering the smallpox vaccines to high-risk populations, including healthcare professionals and people travelling to regions or countries where mpox is endemic. in a study in sa, alshahrani et al. assessed the knowledge level of doctors about the mpox. they reported that participant doctors exhibited highest knowledge level in clinical presentation 69.3% and disease transmission 70.4%. nonetheless, the participants showed a lower level of knowledge in control and preventive measures. in addition, most of the participants showed positive attitudes toward controlling and preventing mpxv, where 84.1% of participants believed that with appropriate preventive measures, mpox could be effectively controlled. collectively, these findings suggested that it is essential to ameliorate the knowledge level of saudi arabian healthcare professionals regarding mpox for effective control and prevention. moreover, these measures not only will facilitate early identification and management of mpox cases, but also the prevention of mpox outbreaks. in a different study, meo et al. assessed the attitudes, knowledge, awareness, public perception, and acceptance of immunization against pandemic threats including mpox among 1020 study participants from riyadh, sa. the researchers summarized that an increased number of study participants in favor of vaccination campaigns and implementation of preventive measures against mpox. therefore, improving public awareness and increased availability of information regarding mpox are like to have significant contributions in strengthening the community to combat mpxv infections and lower the impact of mpox in sa. over 1.8 million pilgrims visited sa to perform hajj and umrah in 2023 alone, therefore it was challenging for responsible authorities to screen each traveler. therefore, government health authorities of sa should strongly collaborate with various international health organizations including who to prevent, manage or monitor potential health risks at most of the entry points in sa including highways, seaports, and airports by ensuring adherence to hygiene protocols, vaccinations, and health screenings. diagnostic testing for mpxv that can be used in saudi arabia real-time pcr any person satisfying the definition of a suspected case ought to be offered testing as per the guidelines of the u.s. cdc and who. in the case of lab-based diagnosis of mpox, rt-pcr is regarded as the gold standard diagnostic method for samples derived from either wild animals or parents. a number of rt-pcr assays have been established for mpxv diagnosis after the emergence of mpox. these rt-pcr methods have been developed for different targets in the mpxv genome including n3r, b6r, f3l, b7r, g2r, and tnf receptor gene. clinical samples were used to evaluate the diagnostic validation. most of the rt-pcr tests have a limit of detection in the range of 250 to 10 copies per reaction. u.s. food and drug administration has granted emergency use authorization of 7 rt-pcr-based tests so far. loop-mediated isothermal amplification although rt-pcr is regarded as the gold standard diagnostic method for mpox, there are several drawbacks of these methods, such as the need for consistent access to electricity, technical expertise, long sample processing time, and usage of an advanced thermocycler for identification and amplification of mpxv genome. therefore, rt-pcr is inappropriate for dispersed applications, especially in middle- and low-income countries. easy-to-use as well as reliable assays and point-of-care testing are required to combat mpox, particularly as the mpox circulates in middle- and low-income countries. considering all these issues, isothermal techniques including loop-mediated isothermal amplification might be the most outstanding methods for rapid mpox detection. lamp is a powerful, simple, low-cost, and rapid technique for rapid nucleic acid amplification at an isothermal and single temperature, which indicates that this method can be performed without the need for expensive equipment. collectively, these features are extremely preferable for poct usage in areas with limited laboratory facilities. serological testing when a test is carried out in isolation, it is advised to use serology for the clinical mpxv diagnosis to detect antibodies in serum or plasma. the effectiveness of serological tests specific for mpxv is decreased via the potential for cross-reactivity with antibodies against other opvs and those exhibited via vaccination, whether historical or recent. therefore, it is indicated that serological testing should be limited to reference laboratories till further validation is given for the usage of serological or antibody-detecting pocts outside such settings. when a serologically validated testing facility is available within a reference laboratory, the igm detection in recently acutely ill individuals or igg detection in paired serum specimens obtained at least 3 weeks apart from the initial sample collection during the first week of illness can enhance the accuracy of the diagnostic method, when results of other tests are inconclusive. in the diagnostic framework, this technique highlights the importance of serology and its potential uses in certain conditions and within the limits of application standards and rigorous validation. crispr/cas-based systems crispr-cas systems are alternative emerging approaches of nucleic acid detection techniques that have simple device structure, high sensitivity and specificity, and outstanding compatibility with several methods for readout including fluorescence or lateral flow assays. extensive advancement has been achieved in the design of molecular diagnostic-based approaches by utilizing crispr/cas components. the crispr/cas systems detect viral nucleic acids based on their dna or rna sequences and then eradicate them by utilizing cas enzyme-associated endonuclease function. the two groups of crispr systems were rapidly utilized for diagnostic purposes including dna endonuclease-targeted crispr trans reporter and specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking. several studies already reported the potential of crispr-cas systems in the detection of mpox. whole-genome sequencing wgs is a powerful, next-generation, and comprehensive sequencing technology that sequences the entire genome of an organism. wgs is considered as the most precise method in distinguishing mpxv from other opvs, which provides extensive coverage of pathogens beyond other molecular techniques. this method also promotes advanced virological study, allows comprehensive bioinformatic investigations, and the design as well as development of relevant immunoassays. wgs is a powerful method for detecting unknown transmission chains, specific genetic variants and strains, and possibly revealing the origin of an outbreak. genetic evolution of mpxv can also be traced by analyzing wgs data, which can provide more data on mpxv adaptation across varied environments and hosts as well as detection of genetic markers for severe disease manifestations or antiviral resistance. furthermore, wgs allows high-resolution mapping of mpxv biogeography and phylogeny and deducing patterns of the mpxv migration by comparing genome sequences derived from a range of outbreaks. there is a growing interest on wgs because of its potential in epidemiologic research, vaccine development, disease treatment, and development of targeted outbreak control and prevention approaches. nonetheless, operational cost of wgs is high and it needs extensive computational resources, which restricts its uses in large-scale testing. there are several challenges in wgs applications, such as scientific, ethical, and practical considerations, as well as the requirement of thoughtful policymaking and constant development. thus, wgs is not suitable as poct because of these limitations. wgs mainly benefits specific case investigations and research initiatives as well as the creation of mpxv databases to enhance findings. electron microscopy electron microscopy can mediate the visual detection of potential mpxv within specimens. nonetheless, because of the need for expensive research facilities, the requirement of specific technical expertise, and the emergence of more available molecular methods, this method is not widely used in mpxv diagnosis. therefore, electron microscopy is not routinely used in the diagnosis of poxviruses. virus isolation and culture virus isolation and culture are time-consuming approaches that can be useful in diagnosing mpox. this method can provide comprehensive characterization via sequencing, which can provide vital insights crucial for the developments of clinical applications, vaccines, research methodologies, and antiviral testing. mpxv isolation from important cases can mediate outbreak investigation and control measures via detecting the mpxv origin, reconstructing transmission chains, and pinpointing mutations via phenotypic and genomic comparisons among isolates. indeed, mpxv shows vigorous growth in various mammalian cell lines including rk-13, bsc-1, vero, and hela, as well as in chicken embryos. in chicken embryos, mpxv stimulates cytopathic activities in the chorioallantois membranes, which is more prominent in 1–4 days post-inoculation, including syncytium formation, cytoplasmic bridging, granulation, and cell rounding. on the other hand, typical detached and rounded cells become more noticeable in vero cells within around 24 h, which allows identification of virus particles by specific antibodies and immunofluorescence. notwithstanding the accuracy of this method, this method is not widely used because of the need for high-level biosafety labs, the risk of infection even after wearing adequate personal protection, the necessity for skilled personnel, and the extensive detection timeframe. prophylactic measures that can be taken in saudi arabia to prevent mpox pre-exposure prophylaxis individuals people in sa might also play a role in limiting mpxv transmission in various ways. confirmed or suspected individuals ought to stay home and avoid contact with other people. immunocompetent people with mild mpox symptoms ought to avoid contact with other people for 3 to 6 weeks. in addition, healthy individuals ought to avoid intimate contact with mpox-infected individuals. people should also maintain cough etiquettes, wear a fitted mask, practice good hand hygiene, and sneeze with a piece of cloth or tissue or by bending arms. appropriate disinfection and cleaning of high-touch areas are suggested after having home visitors. moreover, practicing safe sexual intercourse and having less sexual partners might help in limiting mpxv transmission. according to the cdc, around half of the individuals who are at greater risk have changed their sexual activities and the number of their sexual partners. surveillance systems and public awareness campaigns health electronic surveillance network is an electronic health information system of sa, that provides various public health data including immunization, vaccination, and epidemic outbreak. according to ministry of health strict guidelines, any suspected mpox cases must need to be reported by the healthcare facilities using hesn. this surveillance system ought to monitor suspected cases in sa and travelers from areas where mpox is endemic. confirmed or suspected mpox cases ought to be isolated to avert the transmission of mpox to others, this isolation is especially crucial in healthcare facilities where the risk of mpxv transmission is higher. public awareness campaigns also need to be conducted by the sa government to educate the community regarding the mpox signs and symptoms and methods to avert mpxv transmission. healthcare workers mpox prevention in clinical settings is more challenging since the healthcare workers remain in contact with infected individuals. appropriate personal protective equipment including gowns, masks, and gloves should be provided to healthcare workers to provide protection from mpox exposure. immediate masking of the confirmed or suspected individuals is also essential. furthermore, skin lesions of the affected individuals also need to be covered with a cloth or gown and these individuals need to be isolated preferably in a negative-pressure-containing single-person room in the hospital. workers should wear gloves while handling the laundry of mpox-infected individuals. vaccines there is no mpox-specific vaccine available currently. however, studies have reported that smallpox vaccines can provide up to 85% protection against mpox. moreover, epidemiological data suggest that increased occurrence of mpox was observed in individuals who were born post-smallpox pandemic and eradication period or never been infected by poxviruses or never received smallpox vaccination in childhood. at present, there are 2 approved smallpox vaccines used against mpox. pre- and post-prophylaxis immunizations for a certain group of people are recommended by various healthcare authorities including the advisory committee and immunization practices. fda-approved vaccines including jynneos™ and acam2000® are recommended for healthcare professionals who are supposedly exposed to opvs. these healthcare professionals include scientists researching clinical mpox samples, diagnostic and vaccination teams, response teams against outbreaks, clinical personnel associated with viral disease management, and laboratory workers as well as technicians. therefore, proper vaccination guidelines should be developed in sa to ensure the safety of these healthcare professionals. in addition to the aforementioned 2 vaccines, aventis pasteur smallpox vaccine is also approved for emergency uses when the two other vaccines are unavailable or contradicted for application. smallpox vaccines were previously effectively used to prevent mpox. as there is no report or literature currently available that shows the use of smallpox vaccine by the sa health authorities in saudi arabia, therefore sa government might offer smallpox vaccine to high-risk groups, including healthcare workers and individuals travelling to regions where mpox is known to occur. collectively, sa health authorities should continue to collaborate with international organizations including who to implement preventive strategies and measures to efficiently control the spread of mpxv in order to avoid the next mpox pandemic. post-exposure prophylaxis post-exposure prophylaxis is recommended for individuals following their contact with the skin or mucous membrane of an infected person or with their bedding, clothing, oral cavity, lesions, saliva, and bodily fluids. people can be exposed to mpxv through viral presence in air particles and aerosol secretions, when they share a close space for a longer period. moreover, cdc and fda recommend post-exposure vaccination only for high-degree exposures, where there is a possible risk of contracting mpxv. furthermore, the deficiency of medical masks and protective gloves or contact-used material without post- and pre-exposure sanitization is a condition that necessitates and sensitizes vaccination. it is recommended to go through monitoring or diagnosis before post-exposure prophylaxis, in cases of lower exposure rates or uncertain exposure. mpxv transmission can occur due to extended interaction with symptomatic individuals or infected animals. therefore, according to cdc, post-exposure immunization should be carried out after around 4 days and within 4–14 days to prevent mpox development. however, if vaccination is conducted after 2 weeks, only the disease burden can be reduced but the onset of mpox cannot be averted. therapeutics for mpox treatment that can be used in saudi arabia antiviral agents trifluridine trifluridine is a thymidine analog that acts as an antiviral drug by suppressing dna synthesis. this antiviral drug suppresses dna polymerase and also gets incorporated into dna molecules, nonetheless, trifluridine action might lack selectivity. in the case of mpox, this drug is only used as a topical preparation on the eyes of infected individuals. trifluridine does not cross the intact cornea, therefore it is considered safe when this drug is used as eye drops. nonetheless, this drug might cross the cornea and be noticeable in aqueous humor in case of corneal pathologies disrupting its structure. various mild adverse reactions have been reported with the use of trifluridine, including allergy, inflammation of the cornea, oedema of the eyelids, and temporary local burning sensation. the dosing interval of trifluridine is 2 hours until the complete regeneration of corneal epithelium. after the regeneration, it might be taken once every 4 hours for another 1 week. nevertheless, trifluridine is not recommended to be used for a longer term. alternative drugs might be selected if treatment is required beyond 3 weeks. cash-goldwasser et al. and perzia et al. carried out studies with trifluridine in the mpox treatment. nonetheless, this drug was used by the researchers in these studies as an add-on agent. in general, 5 participants received both tecovirimat and trifluridine. mpox clinical presentations of four participants varied greatly, but all of them exhibited ophthalmological manifestations. these 4 patients quickly recovered and were discharged. however, reduced visual acuity and worsened ocular symptoms were exhibited by one patient. overall, no adverse events were observed with trifluridine. brincidofovir brincidofovir is a prodrug of cidofovir that acts as an antiviral drug by selectively suppressing the activity of opv dna polymerase. therefore, this drug was found to be efficient against dna viruses. brincidofovir is a lipid conjugate of cidofovir. it has been observed that lipid acylic nucleoside phosphonate plays a role as a phospholipid in the body and reduces the development of lesions with no confirmed effect with coupled vaccination. patients were reported to be completely recovered with minimal side effects. therefore, this drug is approved to treat cytomegalovirus retinitis in hiv individuals and also approved to treat smallpox and other related infections. brincidofovir is also a preferred drug for widespread administration during an emergency mpox outbreak. as compared to cidofovir, brincidofovir has no reported nephrotoxicity and provides better oral bioavailability, thus brincidofovir received approval for oral administration. nonetheless, the profile of liver enzymes needs to be strictly monitored and liver function tests need to be carried out for the treatment. moreover, brincidofovir is not recommended for newborns, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals because of the hyperactive drug accumulation. animal studies already demonstrated its effectiveness against mpox, however more clinical studies are required for proper licensure and approval. tecovirimat tecovirimat is an antiviral agent, which originally received fda approval in 2018 to treat smallpox infection. tecovirimat can block the formation of the viral envelope by suppressing p37 polypeptide, which is a highly conserved sequence among all opvs. as mpxv is an opv, therefore tecovirimat might exhibit an antiviral role against mpox. mpox patients in the u.s. can obtain tecovirimat from state, county, or city health authorities through an fda- and cdc-approved expanded access–investigational new drug protocol. cidofovir cidofovir is effective against several dna viruses and it acts as an antiviral drug by terminating dna polymerase-based replication in the form of 5′-diphosphorylated metabolite. cidofovir was found to be effective against infections caused by smallpox, mpox, vacv, and hiv. routes of administration of cidofovir include intravenous and topical routes. indeed, cidofovir not only reduces the symptoms by preventing the formation of lesions, but also decreases mortality rates. in addition, cidofovir is used to treat severe vacv as a second-line therapy. cidofovir was found to result in nephrotoxicity following iv administration, this drug should be administered along with probenecid and adequate hydration. furthermore, proper dose adjustment along with renal functional considerations are needed to manage nephrotoxicity. nonetheless, more clinical studies are required with cidofovir to confirm its potential against mpox. immunomodulators monoclonal antibodies are commonly used to treat orthopoxvirus infections, which can also be used to treat severe infections caused by mpxv. it has been revealed that interferon beta can significantly suppress the mpox generation and spread. therefore, recombinant beta can be used as a safe and novel agent in mpox treatment. more mabs also need to be developed to elevate the potency of immunoglobulin therapy and/or specific antiviral drugs that may ameliorate outcomes of individuals with severe combined immunodeficient individuals. immunoglobulin therapy in 2005, vaccinia immunoglobulin iv was first approved for clinical uses in treating complications associated with the use of smallpox vaccinations. several recombinant immunoglobulins are currently being studied. rvigs act in a strategic passive immunotherapy manner. vig’s two iv formulations including vigiv dynport and vigiv cangene are being studied and yet to be licensed. it was previously utilized effectively in refractive cases. as a hyperimmune immunoglobulin, it plays a role in neutralizing virus particles and decreasing viremia and mortality rates by up to 30% to 40%. in order to develop passive immunity, antibodies are obtained from the plasma of smallpox-immune people. it is also used in individuals with immunodeficiency, since it has adequate maltose to perhaps raises revaccination needs, needs attention for renal insufficient profiles, might interfere with serological testing, and affect insulin levels and glycemic conditions. since there is a lack of human trial data regarding mpox treatment, therefore more studies are required in this regard. challenges and future perspectives despite being a member of the dna virus family, mpox shows incredibly greater genomic variability because of elevated nucleotide polymorphism. increased international travel and rapid population mobility have mediated the spread of mpox among people, which is further facilitating its potential for mutation. in addition, these factors also play a role in drug resistance, increased variability, and appearance of multidrug-resistant strains of the mpox virus. future studies on mpox in sa can result in a better understanding of mpox and its potential to cause public health threats, which will also reduce knowledge gaps. a future mpox pandemic might involve a serious burden in the case of economic development, social activities, education systems, and healthcare facilities. although there is a deficiency of information regarding the specific impact of a mpox pandemic, some findings indicated the need for assessment of the economic burden of mpox treatment in healthcare settings, such as costs associated with hospitalization, public health interventions, medications, and diagnostics. analysis of these factors in sa might aid the estimation of financial resources needed for effective mpox outbreak management. moreover, investigation is also required for the potential mpox impact on the productivity of the workforce in various sectors because of reduced productivity, absenteeism, and illness. conclusions in this review, important insights have been provided regarding epidemiology, transmissions, clinical presentation, diagnostic tests, prophylactic measures and therapeutic options of mpox from sa perspective. recent mpox outbreaks around the world have emphasized the necessity for vigilant and constant monitoring in sa. mpox cases in sa were found to be travel-associated and showed potential close contact and heterosexual transmission. novel therapeutic and prophylactic measures are also needed to be continuously appraised for the potential implications in sa. selective usage of smallpox vaccines in the sa population can also be considered to limit mpxv spread. moreover, lessons learned from the covid-19 pandemic should be applied in the containment and management of mpox in sa.
mpox 2022 to 2025 update: a comprehensive review on its complications, transmission, diagnosis, and treatment abstract monkeypox virus is a zoonotic orthopoxvirus that has gained increased global attention due to recent outbreaks. the current review reports the latest update of mpox cases from 25 february 2022 to 29 april 2025. it also evaluates the possible major complications in human life caused by mpox. in early 2022, more than 40 countries reported mpox outbreaks. as of 12 june 2024, the global case count for the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak was 97,281 confirmed cases, in 118 countries. the world health organization declared the mpox virus, a zoonotic disease, a public health emergency of international concern on 14 august 2024. mpox symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, and face-to-body rashes. the review also highlights mpox virus replication, genomics, pathology, transmission, diagnosis, and antiviral therapies. the 2022 outbreak is also discussed in detail. the coinfection of hiv in patients infected with mpox is also discussed. the evolving mpox epidemiology has raised concerns about the disease’s increasing spread in non-endemic countries, emphasizing the urgent need for control and prevention. the discussion on preventive measures, including vaccination, suggests that cross-protection against mpox may be possible using orthopoxvirus-specific antibodies. although there are no specific antiviral drugs available, certain drugs, such as tecovirimat, cidofovir, and ribavirin, are worth considering. 1. introduction monkeypox is a viral disease caused by the mpox virus. according to the latest report of the world health organization globally, 137,892 confirmed cases of mpox have been reported from 1 january 2022 to 31 march 2025. out of these, 317 deaths were confirmed across 132 countries. mpox virus is an enveloped double-stranded dna with around 200 kb of nucleotides, which is brick-shaped and has a tubule-like structure on its surface. additionally, it has a dumbbell-shaped core structure that measures up to 200 to 250 nm. this virus belongs to the genus orthopoxvirus and the family of poxviridae. mpox resembles smallpox, and the disease is spread via zoonosis. there are two clades of mpox: clade i and clade ii. both have a sequence similarity of about 95%. the fatality rate of clade i is three times higher than that of clade ii. mpox has a linear dna genome that contains around 190 non-overlapping open reading frames. mpox genomes contain a highly conserved central region, while the terminal region is highly variable, having inverted terminal repeats. all mpox viruses have four orfs in the itr region. the gene loss at the terminal region acts as a driving force for the evolution of the new mpox. the ultrastructural analysis study in 2022 revealed that virus replication occurs in the mini-nucleus, which is reorganized by endoplasmic reticulum cisternae in the host cell. the early mrna and late mrna form in the mini nucleus, which consecutively form the early protein and the late protein. as a result, an intracellular mature virus is released in the cytoplasm and comes outside of the cell by exocytosis to form an enveloped extracellular virus or extracellular mature virus, which is ready to infect another host cell. mpox is not considered a sexually transmitted disease, although the mpox virus dna was detected in semen and seminal fluid samples in italy and germany in the 2022 global outbreak. despite various studies on the mpox virus, the anal or vaginal route can be considered a mucosal membrane route. virus mutation and the re-emergence of pathogens with unusual transmission routes may enhance infection and increase the possibility of an epidemic. since 2022, two major mpox outbreaks have prompted the world health organization to declare public health emergencies of international concern, first in july 2022 and again in august 2024. the initial global spread, attributed to a clade 2b strain, resulted in roughly 100,000 cases and 200 fatalities. subsequently, a new clade, 1b, emerged, leading to a second surge. as of december 2024, this recent outbreak has seen over 55,000 reported or suspected cases and approximately 1000 deaths, primarily in the democratic republic of congo and neighboring nations such as burundi, rwanda, uganda, and angola. isolated cases of clade 1b have also been documented in countries including the uk, sweden, germany, belgium, france, the usa, canada, and thailand. the details of the outbreaks of 2024 and 2022 are as follows. 1.1. the 2024 outbreak the mpox clade 1b variant, initially detected in the sud kivu area of the democratic republic of congo, has emerged as a major public health threat due to its increased ability to spread between people. genetic investigation of clade 1b has uncovered numerous mutations of mpox. the genetic makeup of clade 1b shows several mutations in genes related to the enzyme apolipoprotein b mrna editing catalytic polypeptide-like 3 cytosine deaminase. this enzyme’s involvement is often indicative of sustained human-to-human transmission. these genetic alterations distinguish clade 1b from the traditionally circulating clade i variant, enabling more efficient spread through close physical contact, including sexual contact. genetic changes, particularly those linked to apobec3, are thought to contribute to clade 1b’s enhanced transmissibility. since its initial identification, this variant has expanded its reach within the drc to other provinces and has also been reported in neighboring nations like rwanda, uganda, and kenya, signifying a considerable geographical expansion of the outbreak. the democratic republic of congo was the epicenter and reported 3235 mpox infections and 19 deaths as of 11 august 2024. the emergence of the clade 1b mpox in neighboring central and east african countries has raised significant concerns about the potential for a wider regional epidemic. burundi had recorded 545 mpox alerts by 17 august 2024, and 142 were confirmed positive for the clade ib mpox variant. rwanda confirmed its initial two mpox infections on 24 july 2024, prompting the ministry of health to declare an outbreak on july 27. by 7 august 2024, rwanda had reported a total of four confirmed cases of the clade 1b variant of mpox, with no associated deaths. in uganda, initially, six suspected cases were identified in june 2024, and out of those six, two were confirmed later. as of 13 august 2024, kenya has identified 14 suspected cases, with one confirmed positive for clade ib mpox. to date, no deaths have been reported. in august 2024, the clade 1b strain’s spread beyond africa was confirmed for the first time. the virus has also extended its reach to countries in east africa, europe, and asia, underscoring its capacity for worldwide spread. sweden reported a case involving a traveler returning from an affected region, demonstrating the pivotal role of international travel in spreading infectious diseases globally. this event prompted urgent calls for governments to enhance border checks, implement targeted surveillance, and foster international collaboration to control cross-border disease transmission. on 22 august 2024, thailand reported its initial mpox case of a european man with a recent travel history to africa. likewise, india’s identification of its first imported clade 1b mpox case in kerala highlights the potential for international travel to contribute to the dissemination of this variant. from november 2024 to 12 february 2025, four cases of clade ib were detected. in the united states, the first confirmed case of clade ib mpox occurred in california in november 2024, following travel to an affected region. a second case was identified in georgia on 14 january 2025, involving a traveler from a country with ongoing mpox transmission. subsequent cases were reported in new hampshire on 7 february 2025 and in new york on 12 february 2025. these four cases represent independent events, with no epidemiological links established and no evidence of further transmission. the 2024 outbreak emphasized the importance of aligning travel health policies with robust outbreak management strategies to minimize risks from rapidly spreading pathogens. a significant public health crisis unfolded between 2022 and 31 december 2024, with global records documenting over 118,777 mpox infections. between 2022 and 2024, the different regions of the americas documented 67,220 confirmed mpox cases, resulting in 151 deaths across 31 countries and territories. the majority of these cases occurred in 2022, followed by a substantial decline in 2023. a minor increase was observed in 2024, with 5548 cases. the world health organization has determined that the highly contagious clade 1b strain is the primary driver of this outbreak, characterized by severe symptoms and increased mortality. the most affected areas that reported a large number of infections were east, central, west, and southern africa, specifically, burundi, kenya, rwanda, uganda, the central african republic, ivory coast, and south africa. the swift dissemination of the virus in these areas underscores the critical need for collaborative containment efforts and enhanced healthcare systems to effectively address such epidemics. 1.2. the 2022 outbreak before 2022, mpox cases were documented within the african continent. the first case of the 2022 outbreak of the mpox outside the african continent was recorded on 6 may 2022 in the united kingdom. a total of 366 mpox cases were confirmed in the united kingdom until 10 june 2022. on 18 may 2022, portugal reported 14 mpox infections, spain reported seven, and canada reported 13. the first mpox cases in belgium, sweden, and italy were confirmed on 19 may 2022. france, germany, australia, and the netherlands each reported their initial mpox cases on 20 may 2022. switzerland and israel each confirmed their initial mpox cases on may 21. by 24 may 2022, 19 countries had reported cases of mpox. among these, the united arab emirates identified its first case in late may, involving a 29-year-old female traveler from west africa. slovenia also confirmed its initial infection. denmark’s first case was linked to an individual returning from the canary islands. in canada, quebec reported fifteen confirmed cases on 24 may, the same day the czech republic confirmed its first case. the study published in the new england journal on 21 july 2022 reported a total of 528 mpox infections between 27 april and 24 june 2022, at 43 sites within 16 countries. by 27 may 2022, portugal had confirmed 96 mpox cases, and the information regarding demographics, clinical presentation, and exposure was collected from all 96 cases via face-to-face and telephone interviews using standardized case investigation forms. a subset of 27 confirmed cases underwent more detailed investigation, and their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, along with available laboratory and epidemiological findings, are summarized in a previous study published in eurosurveillance in june 2022. the majority of cases of the 2022 portugal outbreak resided in the lisbon and tagus valley region, with single cases in the north and algarve regions. all cases were male, ages ranging from 22 to 51 years. considering exposures within the 21 days preceding symptom onset, few reported contact with individuals exhibiting similar symptoms, and some had a history of international travel. most cases were identified as men who have sex with men, while one reported sex with only women. during the 21 days before symptom onset, most cases with available data reported multiple sexual partners. six cases reported attending a sauna in the lvt region, one frequented a uk sauna, and four reported international travel—three reported contacts with animals. common symptoms included exanthema, inguinal lymphadenopathy, fever, and genital ulcers. fourteen cases were hiv-positive. three cases required hospitalization, two of whom were later discharged. no deaths were reported by 27 may 2022. one middle-aged case reported prior smallpox vaccination. in may 2022, the world health organization declared a global health emergency for a previous mpox outbreak caused by clade iib of the virus. almost 48 cases of mpox were reported from different regions of latin america, such as brazil, argentina, peru, venezuela, mexico, colombia, and chile, by 28 june 2022. in july 2022, the multi-country mpox outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern due to its rapid spread through sexual contact in regions previously unaffected by the virus. this declaration was lifted in may 2023 following a sustained global decline in cases. the outbreak had infected 87,000 people and resulted in 140 deaths. the who attributed the successful containment to a combination of vaccination and public health information campaigns. most of these countries have set up their epidemiological centers for the identification of these viruses. according to the centers for disease control and prevention, as of 7 february 2024, the maximum number of reported cases in the usa is 31,894, followed by brazil, spain, and france. the geographical distribution of the mpox in countries affected in africa is illustrated in figure 2a, while the recent trends of mpox cases in africa are shown in figure 2b. 2. host reservoirs and transmission mpox is a zoonotic disease; central african rodents and primates are the natural hosts of mpox. the mpox virus is primarily transmitted from animals to humans through close contact, such as bites, scratches, or exposure to the animal’s rash, as well as through exposure to their bodily fluids or consumption of improperly cooked meat. transmission can also occur via contaminated materials like bedding or clothing. historically, human-to-human transmission has been less frequent. a 2018 case study reported that a man traveling from nigeria to the uk on september 6th presented with a maculopapular rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy and was subsequently diagnosed with mpox. one of the three attending healthcare workers developed symptoms, was isolated, and had 134 contacts traced and monitored. four of these contacts later became ill. this incident demonstrates human-to-human transmission of mpox from a traveler returning from nigeria to healthcare staff. historically, mpox infection was primarily linked to animal contact or travel to endemic regions. however, the transmission pattern shifted in the 2022 outbreak, with most cases now attributed to sexual contact. over the last two years, predominantly gay and bisexual men have been affected. the study reveals that the risk of public transmission was very low because mpox virus transmission from human to human requires close contact. human-to-human transmission of the mpox virus occurred through direct contact through blood transfusion, respiratory droplet infection, sharing of foods, clothes, and bedding, and sexual activity, especially with male-to-male sex. the mpox virus may be transmitted from the mother to the fetus during pregnancy, and that type of transmission is called vertical transmission. the different proposed model admits that during the entry of the mpox virus through the respiratory epithelium in humans, the mpox virus enters dendritic cells and macrophages, which then enter lymphatic vessels and the lymphatic system. in the same way, when the mpox virus infects the skin epidermis, it first infects fibroblast cells and langerhans cells, which move in lymphatic vessels and then into the lymphatic system. in this way, it spreads all over the body and infects the liver, which may cause serious liver problems. 3. complications associated with mpox the various complications that have been observed in mpox-infected persons are the following. 3.1. neurological and psychiatric complications mpox infections are associated with potential neurological and mental health complications. research conducted in nigeria in 2020 indicated that a quarter of hospitalized mpox patients experienced psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. however, it is difficult to isolate these symptoms from the psychological impact of hospitalization and isolation. neurological issues, including seizures, confusion, and encephalitis, were observed in mpox patients during the 2022 outbreak, with reported occurrences of 2.7%, 2.4%, and 2%, respectively. furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed the presence of mpox-specific igm antibodies. studies indicate that neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in 50% of individuals with mpox infection. badenoch and colleagues suggest that symptoms occur in more than half of cases. these symptoms may arise from the infection itself or the experience of quarantine. additionally, research conducted in iraq has revealed widespread anxiety among the general population concerning the ongoing mpox outbreak. this research sought to evaluate public awareness, perceptions, and anxiety related to the multi-country mpox outbreak within the kurdistan region of iraq. a digital survey utilizing a convenience sampling approach was conducted from 27 to 30 july 2022. the study included 510 participants. overall, the population demonstrated a moderate understanding of mpox, held a neutral attitude toward it, and experienced a moderate level of anxiety. statistical analysis revealed that demographic factors, including gender, religion, education level, and place of residence, significantly impacted awareness and anxiety levels. gender and the residential area also played a significant role in shaping attitudes toward mpox. 3.2. dermatological complications a common characteristic of mpox infection is the appearance of skin lesions, particularly in the anogenital region. skin lesions present as a rash that progresses through distinct stages: initially flat, then raised, and subsequently fluid-filled. these lesions typically resolve with crusting within three weeks. a characteristic mpox rash begins with small, flat or raised lesions, typically 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter. these lesions progress over two to three weeks, evolving into fluid-filled vesicles and pus-filled pustules, often with a central depression, and eventually form crusts. the vesicles and pustules themselves are generally spherical, ranging from 0.5 to 2 cm in diameter, and are notable for their firm texture, deep skin involvement, and well-defined edges. a hallmark of mpox is a unique rash characterized by painful or itchy maculopapular lesions that progress into a vesiculopustular eruption. typically, the rash emerges within one to three days following the onset of initial symptoms. however, variations exist, with some individuals experiencing the rash more than three days after fever onset or concurrently with the fever. lesions commonly manifest on the face, trunk, extremities, genital region, scalp, palms, and soles. the rash often begins on the face and then spreads outward to the limbs, palms, soles, and mucous membranes of the mouth, eyes, and genitals. a higher concentration of lesions is generally observed on the face and limbs. in some cases, oral lesions, known as enanthems, may precede the appearance of the skin rash. a comprehensive review of available research indicates that sore throat is the most frequently reported oral symptom of mpox, while ulceration is the most common oral or peri-oral sign. in one study of 54 patients, all presented with skin lesions, with a significant majority exhibiting anogenital involvement. a large portion of these patients reported lesions at multiple anatomical sites, and a smaller percentage had lesions in the oropharyngeal area. additionally, a substantial number of patients experienced fatigue and fever, while a minority showed no initial symptoms. in some cases, genital ulcers were observed to be painless, accompanied by bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy, resembling the presentation of primary syphilis. a separate international study, tracking 528 mpox infections in 2022, also identified anogenital lesions as a prevalent symptom. this study found that 73% of patients had anogenital lesions, and 41% presented with mucosal lesions. a rash was observed in 95% of patients, with other frequently reported symptoms including fever, lymphadenopathy, lethargy, muscle aches, and headaches. due to the varied and evolving clinical presentation of mpox, especially as seen in the 2022 outbreak, medical professionals, particularly dermatologists, are advised to exercise a high degree of vigilance when evaluating patients with suspected mpox infection. the other study, conducted in 101 patients from thirteen countries, shows that 54% of cases have been found with skin lesions. during the initial five days of infection, papules, vesicles, and pustules were the most frequently observed skin lesions. from days 6–10, pustules became the dominant lesion, followed by erosions/ulcers and crusts/scabs. after day 11, crusts/scabs were the primary skin manifestation. while monkeypox treatment remains largely symptomatic due to the lack of specific antiviral medications, a novel therapeutic approach combining antimicrobial photodynamic therapy and photobiomodulation therapy successfully treated a large facial cutaneous lesion, highlighting its potential as a promising intervention. 3.3. complications related to the coinfection of mpox virus and hiv the covid-19 pandemic, which began in 2020, demonstrated the rapid emergence of viral diseases and the potential for global spread, highlighting the ongoing threat of mpox. mpox may be more lethal for immunocompromised people, such as those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. the coinfection of mpox virus and hiv was first identified and diagnosed in latin america. in 2022, the recent coinfection of mpox and acute hiv was also confirmed in a 24-year-old male with outstretched papules throughout the trunk, face, and genital area. a 2023 review in vaccine reported 6345 confirmed mpox cases across 53 studies, with a 40.32% hiv co-infection rate. according to who, 51% of confirmed cases of mpox have hiv. the outbreak of mpox in multiple countries was reported during 2022–24. according to the who report, the maximum number of confirmed cases came from the european region, followed by america, the african region, and the eastern mediterranean region. co-infection with hiv increases the chance of infection in an uninfected person by enhancing the concentration of hiv on genital organs and genital secretions or by increasing both factors. individuals living with hiv, especially those with compromised immune systems characterized by low cd4 cell counts, demonstrate an increased vulnerability to severe mpox complications and mortality compared to those without hiv. the immunodeficiency resulting from advanced hiv infection elevates the susceptibility to severe mpox manifestations, which can include necrotizing skin lesions, pulmonary involvement, secondary infections, and sepsis. this study analysed 382 mpox cases, comprising 367 cisgender males, four cisgender females, and ten transgender females. the median age of the participants was 35 years, with an interquartile range of 30 to 43 years. at the time of mpox diagnosis, 349 individuals were known to be living with hiv. among those with hiv, 228 were adhering to antiretroviral therapy. concurrent opportunistic infections were observed in 32 participants. the median cd4 cell count was 211 cells/mm3. specifically, 85 individuals had cd4 counts below 100 cells/mm3, and 94 individuals had counts between 100 and 200 cells/mm3. an undetectable viral load was present in 193 participants. severe mpox complications were significantly more prevalent in individuals with cd4 counts below 100 cells/mm3 compared to those with counts exceeding 300 cells/mm3. these complications included the following: necrotizing skin lesions, pulmonary involvement, sometimes with nodules, and secondary infections and sepsis. hospitalization was required for 107 participants, with 27 of those hospitalized resulting in death. all fatalities occurred in individuals with cd4 counts below 200 cells/mm3. within this group, mortality was higher among those with elevated hiv viral loads. immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome related to mpox was suspected in 21 of the 85 individuals who initiated or restarted art, with 12 of these cases resulting in death. tecovirimat was administered to 62 participants, while cidofovir or brincidofovir was used in seven participants. tecovirimat resistance was confirmed in three cases. 3.4. complications associated with heart myocarditis, pericarditis, and myopericarditis have been rarely documented in mpox infection. two immunocompetent, unvaccinated adults in the u.s. developed monkeypox-related myocarditis. they were hospitalized and presented with cardiac symptoms and elevated biomarkers. oral tecovirimat and doxycycline were provided for the treatment of monkeypox, and they were discharged home after recovery without immediate complications. they received no specific treatment for myocarditis, given the rapid resolution of symptoms and normalization of troponin levels. in a 2022 study, thornhill et al. documented two instances of self-limiting myocarditis associated with monkeypox, where patients recovered within seven days without significant complications. one of these patients had a history of hiv with a normal cd4 count. a wide range of viruses are known to cause myocarditis, such as coxsackieviruses and adenoviruses. viral myocarditis can cause dilated cardiomyopathy. the most frequently observed pathological process involves lymphocytic myocarditis with myocyte necrosis, typically developing 10 to 14 days after the viral infection. the occurrence of myocardial involvement in orthopoxvirus infections was initially documented following smallpox vaccination in young military recruits, using live vaccinia-based vaccines. the precise pathophysiological pathways leading to orthopox-induced myocarditis remain to be determined. heart failure, arrhythmias, and other cardiovascular-related problems may also be possible in mpox infection. 3.5. hypotension sepsis complication in severe cases, significant fluid loss due to fever, rash, and capillary permeability can occur. the associated systemic inflammatory response may also contribute to hypotension. these factors combine to reduce renal perfusion, potentially leading to acute kidney injury. vigilant monitoring of urine output and blood chemistry is essential for early detection and to guide the necessity of intravenous fluid replacement. while infrequent, secondary bacterial infections leading to sepsis have been documented in mpox-infected patients with streptococcus pyogenes. prompt identification of sepsis, utilizing standard diagnostic criteria, is essential. treatment should adhere to established sepsis management protocols, including initiating broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics within one hour of diagnosis, rapid intravenous fluid resuscitation with ongoing response evaluation, vasoactive medication administration, and appropriate respiratory support. 3.6. ocular complication ocular symptoms are uncommon but can cause corneal scarring and vision loss. manifestations, potentially from self-inoculation, include conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and other ocular inflammations. the 2022 mpox outbreak showed a significantly lower ocular involvement rate of approximately 1%, compared to 9–23% in prior outbreaks. mpox can present with a variety of ocular symptoms, including redness, frontal headaches, rashes around the eyes, tearing, discharge, and subconjunctival nodules. less commonly, it may lead to more severe complications like keratitis, corneal ulcers, opacification, perforation, and vision loss. in the 2022 outbreak, these ocular symptoms have been observed less often and potentially with reduced severity. though potential underreporting exists, observational studies suggest an ocular involvement rate of approximately 1%, significantly lower than the 9–23% incidence reported in previous outbreaks in endemic regions. newborns have been reported to experience ocular involvement with mpox. additionally, there are documented cases where ocular symptoms presented independently, without concurrent skin lesions. patients presenting with ocular mpox symptoms should be referred for ophthalmologic evaluation. a slit-lamp examination and dilated fundoscopy are valuable tools for assessing the involvement of both anterior and posterior eye structures. retinol supplementation is advised. supportive measures such as eye lubrication and saline compresses may provide relief. in cases of co-infection, ophthalmic antibiotics or antivirals may be necessary. patients should be instructed to avoid contact lens use. topical trifluridine, under ophthalmological guidance, can be considered for conjunctivitis and is recommended for keratitis management. 3.7. fulminant mpox a severe, widespread, and destructive form of mpox has been observed in individuals with advanced immunosuppression, such as those with cd4 counts below 100 cells/µl, high hiv viral loads, or hepatitis b co-infection. these cases show a resemblance to an aids-defining illness. patients showed extensive, large necrotic skin and mucosal lesions that often merged. severe secondary bacterial infections were frequent. complications included lung nodules, necrotic pulmonary masses, nodular hepatic lesions, respiratory insufficiency, and sepsis. immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome was suspected in a quarter of patients initiating or resuming antiretroviral therapy post-diagnosis. mortality was reported in 15% of patients, primarily those with cd4 counts below 200 cells/µl. in moderately to severely immunocompromised patients with uncontrolled viral dissemination, optimal immune function should be prioritized. tecovirimat should be initiated promptly, and consider adding cidofovir or brincidofovir and vaccinia immune globulin. prolonged treatment may be necessary. wound care is essential, and fluid management may be required. specialist consultation should be considered as needed. close monitoring for complications is vital. 3.8. complications associated with immune system like covid-19 infection, mpox also creates cytokines inside the body. cytokines are th2-mediated, and a large number of interleukins are released, while th1-mediated cytokines are released in a lower amount. therefore, ifγ, il2, il12, tnf-α, and ifn-α levels decreased after mpox infection. the human mpox virus causes post-translational modification on the host cell. it downregulates those regulatory factors that increase histone expression while upregulating core histone proteins. the nucleosome formation of viruses depends on host nucleosome modification. mpox has a specific mechanism through which it defends itself via the immune reaction of the host. the intracellular protein of mpox called viro transducer stops apoptosis in the host cell and stops the host cell from responding against the virus. in this way, these proteins evade the host’s immune system to allow for viral replication in the host, as shown in figure 4. the mpox virus uses various strategies in the host cell to escape from the host immune defense system. innate immunity is the first line of defense and is operated by interferons. interferons prevent viral replication in host cells using direct or indirect pathways. there are three types of interferons: type 1, type 2, and type 3. ifnα, ifnβ, and ifnω are considered type i interferons. type i interferons create antiviral activity in cells by activating janus protein tyrosine kinase and signal transducers and activators of the transcription pathway. mpox virus evades the immune response of the host in the following way: an in vitro study in 2010 showed that mpox viral protein b16 inhibits jak-stat induced by type i interferon. another experiment performed in mice in 2004 found that homologs of d7l block interleukin. the complement control protein of mpox inhibits the complement activation pathway, which is a key factor for viral defense. apart from it, many proteins of mpox are responsible for evasion, including ankyrin-like protein, viral growth factor, il-18 binding protein, apoptosis inhibitors, spi-1, inhibitors of mhc class i molecules, inhibitors of irf3 nf-kb activation, inhibitor of irf3 and irf7 activation, inhibitors of mhc class ii, cc, and cxc chemokine binding proteins. 4. diagnosis of mpox pcr is a gold standard molecular biology technique that detects the presence of mpox viral dna in samples such as blood, skin lesions, or respiratory secretions. pcr is a highly sensitive and specific method used for confirmatory diagnosis. real-time pcr is the most common diagnostic procedure for the detection of mpox. in the 2022–23 outbreak of mpox, four novel molecular kits were used: the novaplex mpxv assay, the standard m10 mpx/opx, the real cycler monk-ux/monk-gx v.2, and the realstar orthopoxvirus pcr kit 1.0, with an in-house pcr assay. a comparison study of diagnostic kits shows that sensitivity and specificity were 100% for the novaplex mpxv assay and realstar orthopoxvirus pcr kit 1.0. the realcycler monk-ux/monk-gx v.2 and standard m10 mpx/opx exhibited a slight decrease in the accuracy and diagnostic sensitivity. the lab diagnosis of viral infections plays a crucial role in the detection of diseases and their treatment. cell culture or tissue culture is considered to be the standard method for the isolation and cultivation of viruses, although this method is considered to be time-consuming and has a high risk of contamination. the other standard methods for the detection of viruses are molecular and non-molecular techniques, electron microscopy-based detection, radiation-based virus detection, nucleic acid amplification methods, antigen-antibody complex-mediated detection of viruses, and crispr-cas system-based detection. urine, saliva, semen, and rectal or genital samples can also be taken for investigative purposes, depending on the clinic. crispr-based detection is also a rising diagnostic method in the field of virology. according to research conducted, a system was designed to detect the mpox viral dna using a fluorescence readout. in this study, it was shown that the g-quadruplex oligonucleotide of the target dna, which was labeled with fluorescein on the 3-prime end and black hole 1-quencher at the 5-prime end, produced a fluorescence signal when it was degraded via the cas-12a-mediated collateral cleavage. this effect was not shown in the absence of the target dna because cas-12a is unable to cleave the labeled g-quadruplex oligonucleotide, and fluorescence quenching happens. pan-orthopoxvirus pcr/esi-ms is another emerging method in the field of diagnostics; it can perform identification of all members of orthomyxovirus without sequencing by using the t5000 platform. here, a pcr method coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was employed to diagnose mpox in spiked human samples and aerosol-infected cynomolgus macaque samples. loop-mediated isothermal amplification is another molecular diagnostic technique used in virology, offering a potential alternative to rt-pcr. this technique uses the displacement of the auto-cycling step of dna synthesis by bst dna polymerase, which replicates the gene without the use of a light cycle. 5. treatment of mpox the treatment of mpox primarily focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. the symptoms, like fever, pain, and itching, can be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. antiviral medication such as tecovirimat has been used for some patients with mpox, particularly those with severe illness or who are at high risk of complications. other antiviral medications, such as brincidofovir and cidofovir, may be considered in certain situations, but their use is generally limited. vaccines are also recommended for people at high risk of exposure. to prevent infection with the mpox virus, avoid close skin contact and contact with contaminated materials. most people with mpox experience mild symptoms and recover without specific treatment. severe cases and complications are more common in individuals with weakened immune systems, children, and pregnant women. 5.1. vaccine strategies against mpox almost a thousand cases have been reported from different parts of the world since april 2022, mostly from non-endemic countries; therefore, it has become necessary to understand the possible risk factors associated with this virus. viral inactivation is a crucial step to prevent the spreading of mpox; among the methods of viral inactivation, heat inactivation is one of the methods of viral inactivation. according to batéjat christophe et al., the mpox virus was inoculated on two growth media named fcs and vtm and then subjected to heat inactivation at different temperatures over a period. this study showed that mpox got inactivated in less than 5 min if heated at 70 °c and less than 15 min if heated at 60 °c, and there was no difference between clade i and clade ii. the united states of america currently has three vaccines against smallpox: jynneostm, also known as imvamune, acam2000®, and aventis pasteur smallpox vaccine. this vaccine jynneostm has been prepared from the modified ortho poxvirus vaccinia ankara-bavarian nordic strain and is attenuated in nature and non-replicating. in august 2007, the fda approved acam2000® for the prevention of smallpox. the acam2000® vaccine is also a live vaccine but shows some differences with jynneos™. acam2000® is a replication-competent vaccinia virus, whereas jynneos™ is a replication-deficient modified vaccinia ankara virus. acam2000® shows some major cutaneous reactions, but jynneos™ does not show cutaneous reactions. under emergency use authorization, the aventis pasteur smallpox vaccine can be used, but its effectiveness against mpox is still unknown. the fda approved the use of the jynneos™ vaccine in 2019 to prevent smallpox and mpox. originally, the fda developed these vaccines for the subcutaneous route in a two-dose series. however, due to overwhelming demand, the fda issued an emergency use authorization on 9 august 2022 for the intradermal route in a two-dose series. it was also found that full vaccination with the vaccine through subcutaneous, intradermal, and heterologous routes had an adjusted ve of 88.9%, 80.3%, and 86.9%, respectively. these vaccines are administered to persons who are either suffering from mpox or have been previously exposed to such patients of mpox. these vaccines are also offered to persons who are at high risk of getting infected by mpox, such as gay, bisexual, msm, transgender, non-binary, or gender non-conforming persons and hiv patients. huber et al. have shown the effectiveness of the vaccine on patients suffering from mpox and others with msm, aged 18–49. a total of 309 infected patients were included in this study and found that the adjusted vaccine efficiency was 75.2% 61.2 to 84.2) in patients with a single dose of vaccine and 85.9% in patients with full vaccination. lauren pischel quantified the vaccine efficacy of third-generation mpox vaccines in preventing infection, hospitalization, and death among the global population. they compared vaccinated individuals to those unvaccinated or vaccinated with other vaccines. additionally, they analyzed vaccine efficacy based on the number of vaccine doses and whether the vaccine was administered as post-exposure prophylaxis. a comprehensive literature search yielded 11,892 initial records, with an additional 3223 identified through citation tracking. thirty-three studies focused on third-generation mpox vaccines, predominantly mva-bn. two additional studies reanalysed existing data. the majority of these studies cantered on gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men aged 18–49, conducted between may and october 2022. vaccine efficacy for a single dose of mva-bn was estimated at 76% across twelve studies. for two doses, the vaccine efficacy was calculated at 82% based on six studies. regarding post-exposure prophylaxis with mva-bn, the vaccine efficacy against mpox was 20% from seven studies. all vaccine efficacy estimates were derived from random-effects meta-analysis. in terms of study quality, 18 out of 33 were rated as poor, 3 out of 33 as fair, and 12 out of 33 as good. notably, studies included in the meta-analysis generally exhibited higher quality, with 11 out of 16 rated as good. 5.2. various therapies for the management of mpox 5.2.1. tecovirimat tecovirimat is generally used to treat smallpox, as recommended by the food and drug administration, but under the expanded access investigational new drug protocol, it can also be used to treat mpox. in the united states or canada, tecovirimat is not approved for use against mpox, although tecovirimat is now approved in europe for the treatment of mpox. various clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the efficacy of tecovirimat, but it is not clear. tecovirimat is a small molecule virus inhibitor with strong activity against mpox and other smallpox viruses. tecovirimat’s mechanism involves targeting the highly conserved orthopoxvirus f13l protein. this protein is essential for the creation of enveloped virions, which are necessary for viral spread. tecovirimat functions by acting as a molecular binder, promoting the dimerization of f13l and thereby inhibiting its normal activity. early studies have indicated that tecovirimat did not significantly shorten the duration of monkeypox skin lesions. initial findings from the stomp trial, which spanned multiple countries, failed to demonstrate a notable impact of tecovirimat on the healing time of skin and mucosal lesions in individuals with mild to moderate monkeypox. notably, in the stomp trial, a majority of participants began tecovirimat treatment more than five days after experiencing initial symptoms. according to another study, tecovirimat, which inhibits the formation of p37, was found to be effective in treating mpox. tecovirimat is an inhibitor of the pox virus; however, mpox also shows resistance against many drugs in cell culture, including cmx001 and st-246. the clinical study of mpox was done in france in 2022, where mpox was isolated and sequenced. this study reveals that the effective concentration of tecovirimat against mpox is in nanomolar concentrations, while cidofovir is only effective at micromolar concentrations. therefore, combination therapy may be effective for the treatment of mpox. the efficacy of tecovirimat has been evaluated in vitro and in vivo against a clade 2 canadian 2022 isolate of mpox isolated during the 2022 outbreak, and it was found that tecovirimat prevented mpox replication in vitro with an effective concentration in the nanomolar range. the efficacy of tecovirimat was also evaluated in the cast/eij mouse model with the 2022 canadian isolate. the experiments also show that tecovirimat reduced viral titers after 1–2 weeks of infection. in 2022, tecovirimat was recommended against mpox treatment. in vitro testing has been performed against 2022 canadian isolates of mpox designated mpox/sp2833. the ec50 and ec90, for tpoxx were determined against mpox/sp2833, a clade 1 virus in vero e6 cells is 0.008 ± 0.0014 ± se) and 0.0145 ± 0.0138 ± se). in a recent study published in the lancet journal in 2025, the author conducted an in vitro analysis comparing the susceptibility of clades 1b and 2b to tecovirimat. the clade 1b isolate was obtained in sweden in august 2024 from a traveler returning from africa. for comparison, the clade 2b virus was isolated in france in june 2022 from a patient at the institut pasteur medical center. additionally, ancestral clades 1a and 2a were included as controls, utilizing u2os cells, known for their high sensitivity to mpox virus infection, as target cells. the findings demonstrated that tecovirimat effectively suppressed all four viral strains, exhibiting comparable half-maximal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 15.3 nm to 25.8 nm. 5.2.2. cidofovir and brincidofovir brincidofovir and cidofovir are also being used as dna polymerase inhibitors for mpox treatment, despite not being approved by the fda. in vitro and in vivo studies reported that both cidofovir and brincidofovir can stop the replication of mpox. when brin cidofovir derivative is given to the host, the lipid part of the drug breaks down and releases cidofovir, which forms cidofovir-diphosphate after phosphorylation, which inhibits dna polymerase. in a 2020 study, another new drug was reported, which is nioch-14, having antiviral activity against mpox. 5.2.3. resveratrol a recent study indicated that resveratrol plays an important role in mpox treatment. resveratrol is a natural polyphenol found in grapes, peanuts, pines, and berries. it is also available in red and white wines, but a higher concentration is found in red wine. the maximum amount of resveratrol is found in polygonum cuspidatum. it is also known as japanese knotweed, which has been extensively used for inflammatory treatments in 2012–13. resveratrol is found in cis and trans forms, but the trans form is highly effective in anti-inflammatory activity. the antiviral effects of resveratrol have been explored in several viruses, including the mpox virus, the influenza a virus epstein–barr virus, herpes simplex virus, hiv, and hepatitis c virus. resveratrol inhibits the replication of many viruses. the antiviral mechanisms of resveratrol against various types of viruses are different. resveratrol reduced the virus yield by more than 120-fold at a concentration of 50 mm. the effect of resveratrol against mpox has also been examined using hela cells. hela cells were infected with two strains of mpox virus, mpox-wa and mpox-roc, and it was found that resveratrol at 50 mm concentration reduced the yield of mpox-wa and mpox-roc clades by 195- and 38-fold, respectively. apart from these potential therapies, some other alternative treatments such as top1 inhibitor, chlorhexidine, and cysteine proteinase inhibitors are being explored, but more investigation is required for the effective treatment of these compounds. 5.2.4. plant metabolite as a therapeutic drug a recent study was conducted in 2023, in which the anti-monkeypox capability was evaluated in 56 plant products. among these metabolites, curcumin showed the strongest binding affinity with a value of −37.43 kcal/mol, followed by gedunin, piperine, and coumadin. the study that occurred in 2022 shows various natural compounds obtained from plantago lanceolate targeting on profilin-like protein a42r of mpox virus. the a42r protein of mpox has an amino acid sequence similarity with profilin proteins of eukaryotic cells. profilin family proteins are actin-binding proteins responsible for f-actin assembly in the actin filament and also participate in the regulation of f-actin. silico-based screening identified various important compounds, such as luteolin 7,30-diglucuronide, luteolin 7-glucuronide-30-glucoside, plantagoside, narcissoside, and others. the molecular dynamics simulation and post-simulation analysis revealed that plantagoside and narcissoside were found to be more stable products that were able to bind with the binding pocket of the viral protein of the mpox virus due to hydrophobic and hydrogen interactions. 6. conclusions mpox, while historically less prevalent than other orthopoxviruses, has demonstrated a significant emergence for globally, highlighting the importance of robust surveillance and preparedness. its complications, while often self-limiting, can be severe, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and children. transmission, primarily through close contact, necessitates stringent public health measures to curtail outbreaks. accurate and timely diagnosis, facilitated by pcr testing, is crucial for effective management and containment. while specific antiviral treatments are available, their accessibility and widespread use remain limited, emphasizing the need for further research and development. effective public health strategies, including vaccination and education, are essential in mitigating the impact of mpox and preventing future pandemics. continued research into the virus’s evolving epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and optimal treatment strategies is imperative to safeguard global health. the 2019 coronavirus pandemic demonstrated that disease outbreaks extend beyond physical illness, significantly affecting mental well-being. individuals experienced heightened fear, including anxiety about potential loss and depression linked to isolation. healthcare workers facing direct exposure reported particularly elevated levels of fear. parallels can be drawn with the mpox outbreak, which has also been associated with notable economic and behavioral shifts, manifesting in increased anger, frustration, depression, and anxiety. the health care provider also has very little knowledge regarding the treatment of mpox, so proper guidance and care of mpox-affected people should be done for the management of mental health issues in covid-19-affected people, who issued advisories that may be implemented in mpox cases. the important suggestions to control mental disorders during the monkeypox outbreak are as follows: always study and gain knowledge from an authorized source, such as who. do not come under the influence of people who are already suffering from any mental disorder because of an outbreak. avoid drinking alcohol or smoking during an outbreak because it will only ruin your health condition. hand hygiene practices should be followed regularly. eat a well-balanced diet, and try to avoid sitting alone. even when you are alone in the house, try to chat with your friends or family members via social media. exercise daily. the outbreaks in 2022 across the globe have emphasized the significance of continuous and focused intensive care, along with the development of novel drugs. the limited smallpox vaccine administration and decreasing immunity in the population can enhance virus spreading globally. patients of mpox have different kinds of complications, such as bacterial infection of the skin, skin scarring, permanent corneal scarring, pneumonia, dehydration, sepsis, and encephalitis. it is imperative to provide comprehensive care for patients, including education, nutritional support, hydration, and protection of sensitive organs such as the eyes and genitals. therefore, it is important for the medical professional team, including clinicians, health experts, and nurses, to immediately identify infection in humans and animals, use protective measures, and initiate public health reporting to prevent an outbreak.
infection prevention and control measures to reduce the transmission of mpox: a systematic review abstract objectives to make inferences regarding the effectiveness of respiratory interventions and case isolation measures in reducing or preventing the transmission of mpox based on synthesis of available literature. methods the who clinical management and infection prevention and control 2022 guideline and droplet precautions in healthcare facilities and home isolation infection prevention control measures for patients with mpox. we conducted a systematic review that included a broad search of five electronic databases. in a two-stage process, we initially sought only randomized controlled trials and observational comparative studies; when the search failed to yield eligible studies, the subsequent search included all study designs including clinical and environmental sampling studies. results no studies were identified that directly addressed airborne and droplet precautions and home isolation infection prevention control measures. to inform the review questions the review team synthesized route of transmission data in mpox. there were 2366/4309 cases in which investigators identified mpox infection occurring following transmission through direct physical sexual contact. there were no reported mpox cases in which investigators identified inhalation as a single route of transmission. there were 2/4309 cases in which investigators identified fomite as a single route of transmission. clinical and environmental sampling studies isolated mpox virus in a minority of saliva, oropharangeal swabs, mpox skin lesions, and hospital room air. conclusions current findings provide compelling evidence that transmission of mpox occurs through direct physical contact. because investigators have not reported any cases of transmission via inhalation alone, the impact of airborne and droplet infection prevention control measures in reducing transmission will be minimal. avoiding physical contact with others, covering mpox lesions and wearing a medical mask is likely to reduce onward mpox transmission; there may be minimal reduction in transmission from additionally physically isolating patients with mild disease at home. introduction mpox is a zoonotic disease caused by mpox virus, an enveloped double-stranded dna virus in the orthopoxvirus genus of the poxviridae family. the world health organization declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern between july2022 and may 2023. the 2022 mpox outbreak was associated with sustained human-to-human transmission that had not been previously described. historically, mpox occurred primarily in central and west africa, with infection commonly reported in persons who had contact with probable animal reservoirs, cases of secondary transmission were most often reported in household contacts. increased incidence in endemic areas of central and west africa over the past forty to fifty years coincides with the cessation of smallpox vaccination and eradication programmes. there are two distinct clades of mpox virus, clade i and clade ii. clade ii consists of two subclades, clade iia and clade iib. mpox incubates between five to 21 days and typically presents symptoms in two stages: the invasion period lasting from zero to five days characterized by fever, headache, lymphadenopathy, back pain, myalgia, and asthenia; following this, skin symptoms may appear between one to three days from onset of fever, with a rash evolving from macules to papules, vesicles, pustules and then crusts, often affecting the face, extremities, oral mucous membranes, and genitalia. suspected or confirmed transmission routes of mpox include direct physical contact with an infected patient, indirect contact, inhalation of fomites or infectious droplets, inoculation and transplacental transmission. human infection is also possible from contact with infected animals. areas of uncertainty exist concerning the potential for asymptomatic transmission or the transmission potential of other possible routes, such as breastmilk, semen, vaginal fluids, urine, faeces or insect vectors. there is a need for interventions to prevent the transmission of mpox. the effectiveness of any ipc measures for mpox depends on route of transmission of mpox virus. the who clinical management and infection prevention and control 2022 guideline development group developed two research questions concerning airborne and droplet ipc interventions and one question concerning case physical isolation interventions in mpox. it was expected that scarce evidence, if any, from randomized controlled trials or comparative interventional trials would exist to inform the research questions. as such, it was anticipated that the review questions could be informed indirectly using data on the number of incident cases of mpox by route of transmission and clinical and environmental sampling studies demonstrating viral culture positivity. this is based on the inference that mpox infections will be reduced through interventions targeting the most frequently reported routes of transmission of mpox virus. in the case of ipc interventions targeting airborne and droplet precautions and interventions targeting physical home isolation of cases, if there are a significant number of cases of infection transmitted by inhalation of virus aerosols, droplets or fomites and/or strong viral culture positivity from samples representative of these routes of transmission, interventions directed at preventing transmission via these route would be of importance. therefore, we conducted a systematic review in two stages—the first stage seeks evidence from comparative interventional trials, and the second stage seeks evidence from all other study designs—to inform the infection prevention and control guideline recommendations regarding use of airborne and droplet precautions to mpox transmission and physical isolation of mpox patients. objective • to make inferences regarding the effectiveness of airborne and droplet interventions and case home isolation measures in reducing or preventing the transmission of mpox based on synthesis of available literature. review questions the review followed two pre-planned protocols. the review addresses three research questions developed by the who clinical management and infection prevention and control 2022 guideline development group: 1. does healthcare worker use of respirator versus a medical mask when interacting with a confirmed/suspect mpox patient during the infectious period reduce mpox infections? 2. does the use of an airborne precaution room versus an adequately ventilated room in a healthcare facility for a mpox patient in the infectious period reduce mpox infection in health workers or patients? 3. does isolating a person with mpox until all lesions are fully healed versus not isolating reduce mpox infections? review stage one: review of infection prevention and control interventions for preventing mpox infection in the first stage, we aimed to synthesize evidence concerning the review question interventions from available interventional comparative studies. methods inclusion criteria types of studies population humans with laboratory confirmed mpox infection; or humans with laboratory confirmed mpox-like infection; or humans with symptoms consistent with mpox and exposure to a laboratory confirmed mpox infection or mpox-like infection. mpox-like infection is defined for the purposes of this review as infection due to orthopox viruses other than mpox that are capable of human-to-human transmission, namely buffalopox, cowpox, vaccinia, and variola. types of interventions the administration of any type of vaccine to health care workers or contacts of mpox or mpox-like virus confirmed patients was not considered an intervention type. control outcomes settings all countries and the following contexts were eligible for this review: households, congregate-living, community and healthcare settings. • rcts, controlled before-and-after studies, observational comparative studies in participants with confirmed mpox or exposed to mpox virus. • rcts or observational comparative studies in participants with exposure to or confirmed mpox-like virus infection. • airborne and droplet precautions including medical masks or use of respirators. • personal contact precautions including use of gloves, gowns, eye protection. • isolation of cases • ventilation including natural, mechanical, negative pressure gradient, positive pressure ventilated lobby. • no intervention or; • any different intervention measure used as a comparator to the intervention group in the study. • confirmed secondary mpox or mpox-like virus infection expressed as an absolute number or rate of secondary transmission. • all reported adverse effects related to the interventions. exclusion criteria studies were excluded if any of the following criteria were met: • studies published in a language other than english. • studies of designs other than rcts, controlled before-and-after studies, or observational comparative studies for participants with confirmed mpox infection or exposure to mpox. • studies of designs other than rcts or observational comparative studies in participants with viruses other than viruses defined as mpox-like viruses. • studies that did not include a review question-specific intervention to reduce or prevent the transmission of mpox or mpox-like viruses. • studies conducted in animals. literature search strategy using broad search terms including terms for mpox-like viruses and without date or language limits, the search in september 2022 included the following databases: medline, embase, biosis previews, cab abstracts, and global index medicus. the review author team instituted a call to topic experts for papers concerning the review questions for relevant studies up to 15th december 2022. selection of studies the results of the literature searches were uploaded into distiller sr software. screening of results was undertaken according to the cochrane collaboration’s rapid review methods due to the time-sensitivity of the review findings to inform guideline development. title and abstract screening of all studies identified in the literature searches was undertaken independently by multiple review authors; one author was required to assess a study as eligible for full text screening; two authors were required to assess a study as requiring exclusion. full-text screening against the inclusion criteria was undertaken independently by multiple review authors. one author was required to assess a study as eligible for inclusion to data extraction; two review authors were required to assess a study for exclusion. authors resolved disagreement at any stage by discussion. data extraction and management we planned for two authors to extract data from all included studies using a pre-piloted data extraction form within distiller sr, however no eligible studies were identified. risk of bias assessment it was planned for two authors to independently conduct risk of bias assessments using the cochrane risk of bias 2 tool for included randomized controlled trials and the robins-i tool for included non-randomised comparative studies; however no comparative trials were identified. results we did not identify any studies meeting the inclusion criteria for this stage of the review, so we moved to the second stage. review stage two: transmission route of mpox virus the second stage of the review aimed to synthesize evidence on mpox infection as a result of transmission using a wider range of study designs that could indirectly inform the review questions by answering the following: the infectious period is defined as the number of days since the onset of symptoms. • what is the proportion of incident cases of mpox disaggregated by route of transmission? • an incident case is defined as an individual changing from a state of non-disease to disease over a specific period of time, as reported by study authors. • what is the infectious period of mpox, disaggregated by route of transmission? methods inclusion criteria population: human participant of any age with laboratory-confirmed mpox infection or symptoms consistent with mpox and exposure to a laboratory-confirmed mpox patient or exposure to a suspected human mpox case. the who definition of a suspected case of mpox infection was used. laboratory-confirmed infection was defined as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction positive or viral culture positive. outcomes: type of study: any scientific article of any design including clinical and environmental sampling studies. setting: all countries and all contexts. • mpox infection exclusion criteria studies were excluded if any of the following criteria were met: • studies not including a human case of laboratory confirmed mpox infection or exposure to a laboratory-confirmed mpox patient or exposure to a suspected mpox case. • studies solely concerning animal-to-animal mpox transmission or animal-to-human transmission. • studies not published in english. • experimental laboratory transmission studies. • studies meeting the inclusion criteria but not otherwise containing information relevant to the review questions. literature search strategy and selection of studies the review team used the same search strategy and methods for the selection of studies as for the first review stage. data extraction and management two authors extracted data from all included studies using a pre-piloted data extraction form within distiller sr. one author extracted all relevant data and the second author cross-checked all extracted data. data was extracted concerning characteristics of the study participants including number of primary and/or secondary cases, country, year of study, setting of transmission, clade of mpox, reported nature of contact of participants to a potential or confirmed course of mpox, study author reported modes or potential modes of transmission, and data concerning clinical or environmental sampling including sample type, and day of sample pcr or viral culture positivity from symptom onset. appraisal of study quality risk of bias assessments are related to study design. we did not identify any applicable pre-existing tool to assess the risk of bias in included case reports and case series. we therefore constructed and piloted a series of questions to appraise the quality of included case reports and case series covering aspects of representativeness and comprehensiveness of included participants. quality appraisal assessments were then undertaken independently by the review authors for all included studies; differences were resolved by discussion. data synthesis what is the proportion of incident cases of mpox disaggregated by route of transmission? two authors independently categorized all reported human mpox cases from identified studies by route of transmission. authors resolved disagreement at any stage by discussion. authors assigned the following route of transmission to each case as applicable: direct sexual physical contact, direct non-sexual physical contact, fomite, inhalation, transplacental, needlestick, ingestion or unknown. the routes of transmission are defined as: the review team then categorized all cases into one of three categories: single route of transmission resulting in infection reasonably identified, multiple routes of transmission resulting in infection possible, and unknown route of transmission resulting in infection. the category of a single route of transmission applied when sufficient data concerning the case history, epidemiology, and/or clinical details was reported to reasonably judge that a single route of transmission leading to an mpox infection had occurred. the category of multiple possible routes of transmission applied when more than one route of transmission was judged as reasonably possible to result in an mpox infection based on reported information. authors applied the category of unknown when there was insufficient information reported in the study to assign or hypothesize any route of transmission in a case of mpox infection. the number of incident mpox cases for each route and category of transmission is reported as a whole number and percentage of the total. data are presented for each route of transmission category, by mpox clade, and by route of transmission in the healthcare and household settings. data that could inform the subgroups of the full review questions within the research questions is summarized. authors separated data from included studies into either human mpox clinical samples or environmental samples from an environment occupied by an mpox case. the review team assigned data concerning environmental air sampling, mask sampling, and upper respiratory tract clinical sampling to the review questions concerning prevention of airborne transmission. data concerning environmental surface sampling and clinical sampling of active skin lesions were assigned to the review question concerning case isolation measures. within these categories the review team identified and summarized longitudinal studies and cross-sectional studies that attempted viral isolation. the number of samples for each category is presented. • direct sexual physical contact: transmission occurring in the context of any type of sexual activity, including oral sex, penetrative anal or vaginal sex, or hand-to-genital contact. • direct non-sexual physical contact: direct physical touch with the exclusion of any sexual physical contact as defined above. • fomite: indirect contact transmission involving contact of a susceptible host with a contaminated object or surface. • inhalation: occurs when infectious particles, of any size, travel through the air, enter and are deposited at any point within the respiratory tract of a person. this form of transmission can occur when the infectious particles have travelled either a short- or long-range from the infected person. • transplacental: transmission via the placenta from mother to foetus​. • percutaneous injury: transmission via percutaneous injury with a contaminated object, such as a needle. • what is the infectious period of mpox, disaggregated by route of transmission? summary of findings and assessment of certainty of the evidence a summary of findings table is presented for each review question. data to inform the outcome of mpox infection is inferred from the number of reported mpox cases by route of transmission. data from clinical and environmental sampling studies, representing lower quality evidence, is narratively summarized in the results section. the rating of the certainty of evidence is based on the grade approach for observational studies following the grade guidance as recommended in the grade handbook. search results the searches identified 2514 unique records. authors assessed the full text of 725 studies; 122 studies were included and 603 studies were excluded. the study selection process is presented in s1 fig. included studies 114 studies reported cases of human-to-human mpox as a result of transmission. 39 studies were conducted prior to the 2022 outbreak and 75 studies were published during 2022. the region of acquisition of infection was reported as follows: 37 studies from africa, 1 study from the eastern mediterranean region, 48 studies from europe, 8 studies from north america, and 3 studies from south america. 11 studies reported on cases acquired from multiple world regions, and 6 studies did not report the country of infection acquisition. no studies concerning mpox-like viruses met the inclusion criteria. there were 14 studies that provided data concerning clinical and environmental sampling. studies in which a denominator was not reported were not included. quality assessment of included studies the quality of assessment results are available in s3 appendix. studies generally differed in active case finding and in the reporting of sufficient information to hypothesize route of transmission of mpox virus. included cases there were 4309 cases of human-to-human transmission resulting in mpox infection. all cases of human-to-human acquisition were included; it was not always possible to determine whether a case was a primary or index case. table 1 displays included cases by age and gender. most cases were males over the age of 18 years.it was not possible to disaggregate age and gender for 1062/4309 of cases. results: review question 1 and 2 review questions 1 and 2 are considered together as they concern airborne and droplet ipc interventions. the summary of findings for review question 1 are presented in table 2 and the summary of findings for review question 2 are presented in table 3. number of incident cases by route of transmission most cases of mpox infection reasonably concluded by review authors to have resulted from a single transmission route occurred through direct physical sexual contact. where they could identify a single route of human-to-human transmission resulting in mpox infection, investigators reported no cases in which inhalation could reasonably have been the singular mode of mpox virus transmission. nine studies reported cases of clade iia and four studies reported cases of clade iib. nineteen studies reported cases as west african clade in 2022 before the change in clade nomenclature in august 2022. since they occurred in 2022, it is assumed these cases are likely to be clade iib. twenty-eight studies were published prior to 2022 that did not report clade of included cases. fifty-two studies were published in 2022 that did not report a clade of included cases. most cases of mpox infection resulting from direct physical sexual contact as a single route of transmission were considered to be likely to be clade iib, the clade associated with the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak. the two cases of mpox infection resulting from fomite transmission were clade iib. there were no cases of mpox virus clade i reported in which a single route of transmission resulting in infection could reasonably be identified. reported cases by clade in which multiple routes of transmission were judged as reasonably possible by review authors, or the route of transmission was unknown, are available in the s4 table. eight studies reported 120 cases of transmission resulting in mpox infection within a healthcare setting in which route of transmission may have been direct physical contact, fomite or inhalation. due to limited information reported by study authors, the review team were unable to disaggregate data further. there were 538 cases that authors reported to have occurred within a household setting; however, due to limited reported information, no further disaggregation by route of transmission proved possible.authors reported possible routes of human-to-human transmission resulting in infection as inhalation, fomite, direct sexual physical contact and direct physical non-sexual contact. clinical and environmental sampling two studies attempted viral isolation from respiratory tract samples of patients with mpox; mpox virus was isolated from saliva in 22/33 of samples between days 3 and 9 from symptom onset and in 1/4 oropharyngeal samples taken on day 9 from symptom onset. authors identified two studies in which viral isolation was attempted from air samples collected in hospital rooms solely occupied by individuals with mpox; replication competent virus was identified in one air sample in one study. subgroups health care worker transmission health care workers were the population of interest in review questions 1 and 2. a healthcare worker in the united kingdom in 2018 was diagnosed with mpox after changing the bed linen of a confirmed mpox patient using an apron and gloves; there was no direct physical contact with the mpox patient. investigators judged that transmission was possibly by fomite or inhalational route. three studies reported mpox infection in a healthcare worker through percutaneous injury with a contaminated sharp object that had been in contact with an mpox lesion. patient-to-patient transmission an outcome in review question 2 concerned the risk of transmission to patients. two studies were identified that provided relevant data. jezek et al 1986 reported mpox in a child in the democratic republic of the congo who had visited a hospital several times where another child with confirmed mpox had been admitted. there was no known physical contact between the two. the child with subsequent mpox infection had walked past the mpox infected child in an outdoor space in the hospital grounds and past the mpox patient isolation area. the mpox infected child and the child who subsequently developed mpox had also received injections on the same day at the hospital in which one syringe and 35 needles were being reused for all injections. review authors hypothesized fomite or inhalation transmission. learned et al 2003 reported a case of mpox in a patient hospitalized for malaria and in the same hospital as patients with mpox; authors reported no further information. certainty of the evidence certainty of evidence commenced at a rating of low due to inclusion of observational study designs. evidence from observational studies indicated that mpox was transmitted, in almost all occasions, by direct physical contact. we further found compelling evidence that mpox transmission by inhalation did not occur, or if it did, was extremely unusual. for review question 1, the logical inference was made that if there are no or almost no cases of transmission by inhalation, use of a respirator by a health care worker would prevent either none or very few mpox transmissions. the evidence is therefore at least moderate certainty of little or no benefit in preventing transmission from respirator use. similarly, for review question 2, the evidence is at least moderate that the use of an airborne precaution room probably has little to no impact on preventing mpox transmission. the certainty of the evidence for review questions 1 and 2 is thus based on logical inferences in this situation in which a formal comparison is lacking. results: review question 3 review question 3 concerned ipc interventions related to the physical isolation of mpox patients with active lesions. incident cases by route of transmission in situations in which investigators could identify a single route of human-to-human transmission resulting in infection, 2366/4309 cases were transmitted via direct physical sexual contact, 6/4309 cases were transmitted via direct physical non-sexual contact, and 2/4309 cases via fomites. confirmed clade iib or cases likely to be clade iib form the majority of the data. the two cases of infection transmitted via fomites occurred in healthcare workers who visited a patient’s home for one hour, wore personal protective equipment during the visit, used gloves when taking clinical samples, and did not directly physically touch the patient. it was identified that some equipment used by the healthcare workers may not have been decontaminated before being handled without personal protective equipment. clinical and environmental samples eight studies reported attempts to isolate virus from lesion samples. in four studies reporting the date of clinical sampling from symptom onset, 8/10 of lesion samples contained replication competent virus. in four studies in which the day of sampling was not documented, virus isolation was reported in 46.73% of lesion samples. five studies attempted viral isolation from environmental surface samples. each study sampled high-touch surfaces and items that had been in close contact with infected persons. studies conducted within hospitals included sampling of the anterooms in which personal protective equipment was doffed and disposed, and sampling of the personal protective equipment. gould et al 2022 included sampling of a deposition area in each room which was unlikely to have been touched by patients or staff. morgan et al 2022 compared the frequency and quantity of virus detection from samples of non-porous and porous articles; authors reported that detection of viable virus was significantly more frequent from samples collected from porous materials. the frequency of detection of replication competent virus was between 0 and 60% in surface samples. certainty of the evidence certainty of evidence commenced at a rating of low due to inclusion of observational study designs. evidence from observational studies indicated that mpox was transmitted, in almost all occasions, by direct physical contact. there were very few cases of fomite transmission. the logical inference was made that there may be minimal added benefits to physically isolating cases provided all lesions are covered, direct physical contact with others is avoided and a medical mask is worn. the certainty of the evidence for review question 3 is based on a logical inference in this situation in which a formal comparison is lacking. discussion we found no evidence from randomized controlled trials or observational comparative studies concerning airborne and droplet interventions or case physical isolation measures in mpox or mpox-like viruses capable of human-to-human transmission. investigators reported no cases of mpox infection in which transmission by inhalation could reasonably be identified as the single route of transmission. investigators reported 2 out of 4309 cases in which mpox virus could have reasonably been exclusively transmitted resulting in infection through fomites. in comparison, in 2366/4309 cases investigators identified transmission resulting in infection occurring through direct physical sexual contact. study investigators identified infectious mpox virus in saliva and oropharyngeal swabs and identified competent virus in 1/28 air samples. viral isolation was successful in 101/209 of lesion samples from 8 studies; surface sampling in domestic and healthcare environments in 5 studies detected viable mpox virus in 16.2% of samples. the presence of infectious virus in clinical samples and environmental samples provides only very low certainty evidence regarding risk of transmission that may lead to infection. there is scarce data concerning transmission of mpox to health care workers. mpox infection in healthcare workers was identified through percutaneous injury in three cases and through possible fomite or inhalation in one case. strengths and limitations this review is strengthened by a comprehensive search strategy across multiple databases and authors independently assessed all studies for eligibility in duplicate to identify all possible relevant literature. further, a clear conceptual data framework to address the research questions was undertaken; key data from all available literature that could inform the research questions was identified and synthesized in the two review stages. this review is limited by the existing available evidence base on mpox. the review team utilized only broad search terms inclusive of terms for mpox-like viruses however no comparative interventional studies were identified. there is limited epidemiological evidence on the risk of fomite and inhalational transmission, and limited evidence on the infectious period for different routes of transmission. inclusion of studies in english only may have influenced the completeness of findings. we expect publication bias to be sensitive to transmission routes resulting in infection; that is, if a route of transmission had been identified by investigators, this is likely to be published and captured for inclusion in the review and conversely, if a route of transmission had been not found, it is unlikely to be published. another limitation of the review is the time elapsed since the literature search date and the call to topic experts in december 2022 to identify any further evidence. we are not aware of any systematic reviews addressing the same review questions covering the same scope or with as comprehensive inclusion criteria since the date of our literature search. to our knowledge there is also no known prior systematic review investigating airborne or droplet precautions or case home isolation ipc measures for mpox or mpox-like viruses. this review is an example of evidence synthesis methods in an area of scarce literature to answer key public health questions. implications for practice and research the findings of this review provide compelling evidence that transmission of mpox resulting in infection occurs primarily through direct physical contact. this finding agrees with a recent analysis of global surveillance data reporting the most common route of transmission in the 2022 mpox outbreak was direct physical sexual contact. secondary household attack rates are estimated to be 10% overall. household contact is the most common reported route of acquisition of infection amongst children, but sexual contact is the commonest reported route of transmission amongst adults. marshall et al investigated exposures amongst 313 healthcare workers in different settings, noting duration and type of contact as well as personal protective equipment used. no cases of mpox resulted from a range of contacts including direct skin-to-skin contact with lesions and exposure to aerosol generating proceedures with or without ffp3/n95 masks. most of these contacts were brief. it is difficult to distinguish between the transmission risk posed by close physical non-sexual contact and sexual contact. however more skin exposure, contact between mucous membranes or duration of contact may increase risk of transmission. in the 2022 global mpox outbreak, primary lesions commonly occurring at sites of sexual contact e.g. genital/anorectal or oral lesions and clustering of lesions at those sites support the conclusion that direct sexual contact is an important route of transmission. in line with current guidance, avoidance of direct contact with skin lesions would likely reduce risk of transmission. epidemiological evidence and data from clinical and environmental sampling provides limited support for the hypothesis that inhalation or fomite modes of transmission are significant. replication competent virus has been identified in saliva; precautions to avoid direct exposure to respiratory droplets may be appropriate pending further data. the impact of airborne and droplet ipc measures in reducing transmission may be small. there is potential for shedding of infectious virus onto surfaces from lesions of detached scabs; covering mpox lesions is likely to reduce onward transmission however there is probably minimal reduction in transmission from added physical isolation of patients. suitable cleaning protocols and caution around sharing items such as bedding or towels which may be contaminated is recommended in some settings. multiple factors such as route of exposure, infecting dose, susceptibility of the exposed individual would likely affect the relative risk of transmission resulting in infection. currently, recommendations for airborne and droplet precautions and case home isolation ipc measures in mpox rely on expert opinion and inferences from data concerning transmission frequency by route of transmission. conclusion no available evidence from comparative interventional studies addressing airborne and droplet precautions and case home isolation ipc measures to prevent the transmission of mpox exists. current findings suggest that transmission resulting in infection occurs primarily through direct physical contact. no cases of transmission resulting in infection via inhalation were identified; the impact of airborne and droplet ipc measures in reducing transmission may be minimal. covering mpox lesions, wearing a medical mask and avoiding physical contact with others is likely to reduce onward transmission; there is probably minimal additional reduction in transmission from also physically isolating patients. further research is needed into effective ipc measures to reduce the transmission of mpox, especially in the event of any future outbreak and in endemic settings. supporting information
mpox and lessons learned in the light of the recent outbreak: a narrative review abstract according to the who, more than 90,000 cases of mpox have been reported since the 2022 worldwide outbreak, which resulted in 167 deaths, while a new outbreak in africa since 2023 has resulted in over 18,000 cases and 617 deaths. mpox is a zoonosis caused by the monkeypox virus, a double-stranded dna virus belonging to the orthopoxvirus genus, which causes smallpox-like illness. until 2022, cases were predominately located in west and central africa, with only sporadic cases and outbreaks reported in other parts of the world. during the 2022 outbreak, the primary mode of transmission was sexual contact among men who have sex with men. the changing epidemiology of mpox resulted in new disease phenotypes and populations at risk, disproportionally affecting people who live with hiv. commonly presenting as a mild, self-limiting illness, mpox can cause severe and protracted disease in people with hiv with a cd4 count < 200 cell/mm3. the global emergence of mpox that followed and intersected with covid-19 mobilized the scientific community and healthcare stakeholders to provide accurate diagnostics, preventive vaccines and treatment to those most affected. despite existing gaps, this rapid response helped to contain the outbreak, but challenges remain as new variants emerge. preparedness and readiness to respond to the next outbreak is crucial in order to minimize the impact to the most vulnerable. 1. introduction the worldwide outbreak of mpox in 2022 brought this previously neglected disease into the spotlight. endemic in west and central africa for decades, mpox emerged, for reasons not yet quite understood, in the aftermath of the covid-19 pandemic, but it also intercepted with the hiv epidemic, disproportionately affecting people living with hiv and men who have sex with men. the reflexes of the scientific community and health policymakers were immediate as they swiftly mobilized resources and implemented measures to address the situation. the preceding covid-19 pandemic had laid the groundwork for the rapid recognition and surveillance of the mpox epidemic as well as vaccine production and delivery, public communication and the implementation of preventive strategies to contain the disease. the already-established networks of sexual health/hiv services and community stakeholders took on the task of informing the populations most at risk and implementing prevention, testing and treatment protocols. this review outlines the origins and virology of the monkeypox virus as well as its clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment. it also lays out the available preventive measures, with a focus on vaccination, and discusses the preparedness of global and community leaders to effectively respond to this outbreak as the world anticipates the next one. 2. taxonomy and virology mpxv is an enveloped double-stranded dna virus belonging to the poxviridae family of the genus orthopoxvirus and is closely related to vaccinia virus, the cause of smallpox. the name of the virus originates from its discovery in 1958 in copenhagen in laboratory cynomolgus monkeys presenting smallpox-like disease. although the primary host of the virus is still elusive, various african rodents have been reported to be potential reservoirs, whereas apes and monkeys are considered to be intermediate hosts. after the 2022 outbreak, a nomenclature change was suggested to destigmatize the disease, resulting in the adoption of the name mpox for the disease caused by mpxv by the world health organization. a consensus was also reached to rename the two viral clades, previously known as congo basin and west african, to clades i and ii, respectively. furthermore, two subclades of clade ii were recognized, with clade iib referring to the virus that caused the 2022 outbreak. more recently, an offset of clade i was identified, named clade ib, that caused an outbreak with sustained human-to-human transmission in the democratic republic of the congo. poxviruses are characterized by their cytoplasmatic replication, in contrast to other dna viruses whose reproduction takes place inside the cell nucleus. moreover, they are among the largest viruses, with mpxv reaching a length of 220–450 nm and having a brick-like shape. the core of the mature virion contains 197 kb long linear dsdna and core fibrils, and it is surrounded by the core membrane and a palisade layer that gives the core its characteristic biconcave shape. two lateral bodies are located between the core and the outer membrane, while spontaneously released virions are also surrounded by a lipoprotein envelope. due to their large size, poxviruses are easily detected by host immune defenses and have a more prolonged replication cycle in comparison with smaller viruses. therefore, they employ elaborate strategies to survive in the host cell, producing molecules that disrupt the host’s defenses, both within the cell and extracellularly. intracellular virulence factors include virotransducer and virostealth proteins, which act by dampening the cell’s response to infection and by reducing the detection of the infected cell by the immune system, respectively. on the other hand, viromimic proteins act in the extracellular space and include viroreceptors and virokines. viroreceptors bind and virokines mimic chemokines and cytokines secreted by the host, consequently evading their antiviral action and promoting viral survival and replication. despite the abundance of these virulence factors in all poxviruses, each virus exhibits its own set of immune-evasion tactics, resulting in pathogenic differences, even within the same species. for example, clade i mpxv expresses a complement-binding protein that interferes with complement activation, which is absent from clade ii mpxv. this may partly explain the higher fatality rate of mpox in central africa, where clade i is prevalent, and the relatively more benign disease during the 2022 epidemic caused by the clade iib variant. moreover, facilitated human-to-human transmission of both the clade iib and ib mpxv has been proposed to result from noncanonical viral evolution driven by the accumulation of characteristic mutations associated with the action of the apolipoprotein b messenger rna editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide 3. apobec3 enzymes belong to the cytidine deaminase family, introduce g → a mutations to the complementary dna and demonstrate antiviral properties. experimentally, human apobec3f has been found to cause hypermutations in the mpxv genome, which may have driven the viral evolution that has been seen to contribute to the recent epidemics. 3. origin and epidemiology 3.1. west and central africa after its first appearance in 1958, mpxv outbreaks in imported captive primates were recorded in the us and the netherlands for the next 10 years, yet no human case was recorded. in 1970, the first case of mpox in humans was reported in a 9-month-old child from the drc, who presented with smallpox-like disease. since then, several west and central african countries have reported sporadic cases and self-contained outbreaks related to animal contact, with limited human-to-human transmission. in the period 1996–1996, the drc recorded a more serious outbreak with more sustained human-to-human transmission. as the universal variola vaccination, which was 85% effective in preventing mpox, was halted after the success of the smallpox eradication programme in 1980, population immunity gradually waned. the first outbreak outside africa was recorded in the usa in 2003 and originated from prairie dogs, which in turn had been infected by imported rodents from ghana. during this outbreak, mpxv clade ii caused 72 confirmed or suspected cases, with no proven human-to-human transmission or fatalities being reported. in the meantime, mpox remained endemic in the drc, with cases also recorded in 9 other countries in west and central africa. surveillance of the disease showed a steadily increased incidence between 1980 and 2005, continuing through 2013. in early 2022, a systematic review showed that published cases almost doubled between 2000 and 2009 and 2009 and 2019, with the majority of cases reportedly being caused by clade i. in 2017, after 40 years of no reported cases, nigeria reported its first outbreak of clade ii mpox, which was the source of the first exported human cases outside africa that were recorded in the united kingdom, israel and singapore. this outbreak was characterized by sustained human-to-human transmission, while the epidemiological data suggested sexual contact to be among the possible modes of transmission. this outbreak was caused by the clade iib virus that eventually gave rise to the mpxv lineage b.1, the cause of the 2022 global outbreak. 3.2. 2022 global outbreak in early may 2022, the who reported the first cases of mpox in the united kingdom that were not related to travel to endemic countries, raising concern for community spread, and by mid-may 2022, cases were reported in 12 countries. gradually, more countries started to report cases in all six who regions. on 23 july 2022, the who director-general declared this outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern. as of 7 february 2024, nearly 92,000 cases of mpox have been recorded in more than 100 countries not endemic for mpxv, resulting in 156 deaths. the worldwide epidemic disproportionately affected msm, while intimate sexual contact was the main route of transmission. the epidemic reached its peak in august 2022 and, despite cases being on the decline since then, low levels of transmission are still reported. this outbreak, caused by a new mpxv lineage, marked a significant change in mpox epidemiology, risk factors and clinical presentation and raised awareness of a previously neglected disease. the pheic was declared to be over in may 2023 after there had been a sustained decline in global cases. 3.3. 2023–2024 outbreak as early as september 2023, an epidemic of a new variant of clade i mpxv, called clade 1b, began in central africa. the africa centres for disease control and prevention reported an increase of approximately 160% from the previous year. during 2024, over 21,000 mpox cases due to mpxv clade i and clade ii have been reported from 13 african union member states, including over 3000 confirmed cases, in burundi, cameroon, central african republic, republic of the congo, côte d’ivoire, drc, ghana, liberia, kenya, nigeria, rwanda, south africa and uganda. in drc, most cases and deaths reported were among those < 15 years of age, representing 66% of the total cases and 82% of the total deaths. males accounted for 73% of the cases in drc. in congo, based on information provided by the africa cdc, most confirmed cases were children < 15 years of age and 58% were male; similarly, in the central african republic, 43% of the confirmed cases were < 15 years of age and 62% were male. as of august 2024, 18,737 suspected cases and 617 deaths have been reported in 13 african countries, nearly all in the drc. this rate is significantly higher than the previously reported fatality rate of less than 0.1% recorded during the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak. however, the size of these outbreaks could be much larger than reported due to under-ascertainment and under-reporting in those areas. consequently, the true number of infections is likely to be higher than the reported figures, while the case fatality rate may have been overestimated. moreover, it is reasonable to assume that community transmission is occurring in several african countries, considering the wide geographic distribution of cases and the diverse age groups involved. as a result, on 14 august 2024, the world health organization declared the epidemic to be a second public health emergency of international concern. on 15 august 2024, sweden reported the first imported case of mpox due to mpxv clade ib in eu/eea countries. hence, on 16 august, the european centre for disease prevention and control adjusted the risk level of clade i for the european population, raising it from “very low” to “low” in response to the anticipated rise in imported cases across the region. nonetheless, the ecdc noted that the risk depended on type of contact and the population immunity setting. despite this, the agency stressed that the probability of the ongoing transmission of the virus strain within europe remained minimal. 4. risk factors understanding the risk factors associated with mpox transmission and spread is important to implement effective prevention and infection control strategies. zoonotic transmission occurs through direct contact with bodily fluids, the mucosal and cutaneous lesions of infected animals such as rodents and primates or the consumption of undercooked meat from infected animals. this is a significant risk factor, particularly in regions where interactions between humans and wildlife is common, including in rural areas with dense forests or regions with tropical rainforests such as central and west africa. despite human-to-animal transmission being uncommon, a few cases of human-to-dog transmission have been reported. although zoonotic transmission is the primary mode of infection, human-to-human transmission may prevail during outbreaks, involving the inhalation of respiratory droplets or direct contact with the lesions or bodily fluids of a patient. factors such as overcrowding, poor sanitation and inadequate healthcare infrastructure may facilitate the spread of mpox. nosocomial outbreaks and the transmission of mpxv during laboratory research as well as vertical transmission through the placenta have also been reported. socioeconomic disparities, including communities with limited access to healthcare, education and resources and cultural practices, including the hunting, handling or consumption of wildlife, are additional risk factors for mpox. primary zoonotic mpox is more common in men, as they are more likely to be hunters, and in younger individuals, as they are more likely to eat undercooked infected animals. in the 2022 outbreak, however, among the cases with known data on sexual behavior, 85.5% identified as msm; among the cases who reported a type of transmission, 83.5% reported a sexual encounter. sexual transmission has been suggested because virus dna has been detected in seminal fluid. the r of mpox during the current outbreak in italy was 2.43 among msm, showing that the virus has the potential to cause epidemics in this population. people unvaccinated against smallpox are at an increased risk of infection, while pediatric patients or young and immunocompromised adults such as plwh are at a higher risk of severe disease. mpox in people living with hiv a recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of hiv infection among patients diagnosed with mpox was 41%. more specifically, studies from europe and north america reported high prevalences of hiv co-infection of about 41% and 52%, respectively, while studies from nigeria in africa reported a relatively low prevalence of 21%. during the 2017/2018 nigerian mpox outbreak, 22.5% of hospitalized patients with mpox were plwh. in the 2022 global mpox outbreak, 52% of the confirmed mpox cases were plwh, predominantly sexual and gender minority groups, indicating that sexual activity was underestimated as a major risk of transmission before the 2022 outbreak. living with hiv, receiving pre-exposure prophylaxis or reporting ≥ 20 sexual partners in the past 12 months as well as sex in sex venues/parties in the past 2 months were found to be independent risk factors for mpox diagnosis. it has been reported that plwh with mpox have a higher frequency of perioral lesions and pharyngitis as well as a higher number of sexually transmitted infections. individuals with advanced or uncontrolled hiv infection are at a higher risk of severe mpox. the combination of hiv-induced immunosuppression and the virulence of the monkeypox virus may result in increased viral replication, prolonged disease and a higher risk of complications. severe complications and systemic manifestations were more common in people with a cd4 cell count < 100 cells/μl than in those with > 300 cells/μl, while death was observed in people with cd4 counts of < 200 cells/μl and with a high hiv viral load. mpox severity was also related to poor hiv continuum of care outcomes and low cd4+ cell counts, while increased mortality was reported in plwh with cd4+ counts < 50 cells/μl. in one study, the case fatality rates of mpox disease were 9.4% and 20.8% overall and in hiv-positive cases, respectively, demonstrating that hiv infection is associated with a higher risk of contracting and dying from mpox. in particular, plwh with a cd4 t cell count < 50 cells/μl face a high risk of mortality due to mpox. furthermore, a cohort of plwh and mpox, which predominantly included individuals with advanced or uncontrolled hiv infection, showed that this population was significantly more likely to experience severe mpox manifestations and prolonged disease compared with those without hiv. on the contrary, other studies showed that there was no significant difference in disease severity and presentation between groups with and without hiv, especially for those with well-controlled hiv infection, suggesting that hiv status itself may not be a risk factor for mpox severity, but an indicator for increased sexual risk behaviors and, therefore, mpox transmission. healthcare providers and public health stakeholders should address the vulnerabilities of plwh and prioritize early detection, prompt treatment initiation and comprehensive care in order to improve the outcomes of mpox disease in this population. 5. clinical presentation the incubation period of mpox exhibits great variability depending on the outbreak and the presumed mode of exposure. it is estimated that the average duration between infection and symptom onset ranges from 5 to 13 days. the clinical presentation of mpox includes both a systemic illness and system-specific symptoms. studies of more recent outbreaks reveal a greater variability in the relationship between systemic disease and organ-specific symptoms. in this review, we delineated the most common clinical presentations observed in the 2022 outbreak, categorized by organ system and with respect to the natural course of the disease. systemic symptoms of mpox correspond with the active replication of the virus and may predate or follow the appearance of the characteristic rash. these symptoms include, but are not limited to, fever, headache, myalgia, fatigue and lymphadenopathy, lasting for one to five days. during the 2022 outbreak, the clinical presentation was frequently associated with rash development in the absence of systemic illness, while lymphadenopathy was usually related to the appearance of the skin rash. the characteristic rash is typically well circumscribed and follows a predictable evolution timeline. lesions described in the 2022 outbreak typically evolved in an asynchronous manner over 7 to 14 days, starting as macules of 2 to 5 mm on an edematous background and then evolving to papules, vesicles and umbilicated pustules before crusting and healing with complete re-epithelialization. pruritus is commonly associated with the crusting period. rarely, lesions coalesce into plaques or ulcerate and become necrotic. the number of lesions can vary from 1 to 20 on average, with some cases presenting up to 100 lesions. in the recent outbreak, these lesions were more often located in the perioral, genital and perianal area, with fewer lesions appearing on the trunk or extremities, suggesting a possible correlation between sites of inoculation and lesion appearance. perioral and oral lesions are usually circular and white, commonly ulcerative in nature and with a central depression. they may appear on the tongue, lip mucosa, tonsils or pharynx and are associated with pain and dysphagia. genital lesions are usually solitary, located on the prepuce or the glans of the penis in males and on the labia in females and are almost universally associated with severe pain and edema. typically, perianal and anal lesions mimic proctitis, causing painful bowel movements; they are associated with discharge and bleeding and, in rare cases, with bowel perforation. their morphology is more ambiguous, spanning from vesicles to pustules to ulcers, often resembling herpes, syphilis, lymphogranuloma venereum or other pathologies. the most common ocular manifestations of mpox include conjunctivitis, blepharitis, keratitis and secondary cellulitis, leading, in some cases, to loss of vision. the involvement of the central nervous system in the form of encephalitis and encephalomyelitis have been described, although it has not been elucidated if these manifestations represent a consequence of mpox infection or a secondary immune-mediated phenomenon. other systems can also be affected, causing severe complications such as sepsis, necrotizing lymphadenopathy, bronchopneumonia, myocarditis, abscess formation and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. in a nationwide uk cohort, severe pain and secondary bacterial infection were the most common complications in hospitalized patients with mpox. 6. diagnosis mpox should be suspected in all patients with consistent clinical, laboratory and epidemiological findings. it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all patients presenting with a morphologically suspicious rash, especially if consistent symptoms from other systems are present. a history of contact with suspected or confirmed cases or recent travel to areas where mpox is endemic or where outbreaks have been reported should be taken into account. in terms of laboratory testing, a polymerase chain reaction performed on material collected from typical lesions is considered to be the gold standard for mpox diagnosis. in the setting of numerous lesions, the sampling of multiple sites may increase the diagnostic accuracy. a pcr using throat swabs and blood adds little to the diagnosis in a clinical setting. antibody testing for mpox may be performed when a pcr is not readily available, with a relatively narrow seroconversion window after the appearance of symptoms. despite its value in research, electron microscopy is not considered feasible for routine diagnosis. histopathological findings in tissues presenting typical lesions are non-specific and have little value in clinical practice. a high index of suspicion and the availability of pcr testing are the cornerstones for an accurate and timely diagnosis of mpox. mpox needs to be differentiated from other exanthematous diseases such as chickenpox, measles, scabies, hand–mouth–foot disease, genital herpes, syphilis and other sexually transmissible infections. lymphadenopathy is common in mpox, but mostly absent in chickenpox. herpes often causes oral or anogenital polycyclic lesions, usually in people with similar previous episodes. when genital ulcers or proctitis are present, the recommended method for accurate diagnosis is pcr testing. furthermore, when sexual transmission is suspected, testing for other stis should also be conducted. 7. treatment the management of mpox infection should take into account the disease severity, clinical manifestations and involvement of specific anatomic sites as well as the immunological status of the patient, the risk of progression to severe disease and the development of complications. in the majority of immunocompetent patients, mpox presents as a mild clinical syndrome that can be optimally managed by supportive measures and minimal, if any, medical intervention. supportive measures should aim to optimize nutrition and hydration, pain management and the prevention of possible complications. hospitalization is usually indicated for patients experiencing severe infection who are at risk of malnourishment or dehydration due to lesions located at the level of the rectum or the oropharynx and for patients who develop complications or need intensive pain management. antiviral therapy is not indicated for all patients, but it is recommended for those with severe disease presenting with numerous confluent lesions, neurological manifestations and respiratory or multisystemic involvement. patients with a documented history of autoinflammatory and/or exfoliative skin disorders and ocular manifestations as well as patients with multimorbidity are also candidates for antiviral therapy. an immunocompromised status such as advanced hiv infection, hematological malignancy, bone marrow or solid organ transplantation, chemotherapy or radiation as well as documented autoimmune disease are all strong indicators for antiviral treatment. very young and very old individuals as well as pregnant and breastfeeding people can also benefit from antiviral therapy. the timing of antiviral therapy initiation is based on limited clinical data; however, early treatment initiation after the appearance of symptoms is thought to be associated with a more rapid clinical response and favorable clinical outcomes. the mainstay of antiviral therapy for mpox is tecovirimat, an agent with a favorable safety profile and mild side effects whose efficacy is being increasingly supported by observational data, especially for patients with severe disease and when started early in the course of disease. evidence from randomized clinical trials is currently lacking; however, several rcts are now ongoing. the preliminary results from palm 007 suggest that tecovirimat is safe, but it did not improve clade i mpox outcomes. whether or not this is a clade-specific outcome remains to be investigated. tecovirimat is an inhibitor of the orthopoxvirus vp37 envelope-wrapping protein, effectively limiting the formation of the extracellular virus particle, necessary for viral dissemination within the host. a low barrier to the virus developing resistance to tecovirimat should be considered before treatment initiation and its overuse, especially in mild cases, should be avoided. it is available in oral and intravenous formulations. orally, the administered dose is 600 mg q12hr for those < 120 kg and q8hr for those > 120 kg. the intravenous form is administered at 200 mg q12hr for those < 120 kg and at 300 mg for those > 120 kg. a switch from intravenous to oral treatment should be considered for patients who are able to take oral medication. treatment typically lasts 14 days but, in selected cases, the treatment duration can be extended. possible drug interactions with immunosuppressive agents and antiretroviral treatment should be considered before treatment initiation. when tecovirimat is not available, cidofovir and brincidofovir represent alternative regimens that have been used in clinical practice with less favorable side-effect profiles and very limited data concerning efficacy. in patients with ocular mpox, tecovirimat is strongly advised with the addition of trifluridine in the form of eye drops or ointment applied q4hr for 7 to 10 days. skin lesions that fail to heal, extend despite treatment or show changes in terms of the morphology, associated erythema or other signs of inflammation must be evaluated for bacterial superinfection and appropriate antibiotic treatment initiated. 8. prevention 8.1. contact precautions the implementation of effective infection control measures such as contact precautions is essential for the prevention of mpox transmission and spread within healthcare and community settings. however, increased community awareness and wider surveillance of cases through publicity and education about the risk factors, prevention and treatment of mpox are crucial to control and eliminate infection as well as to minimize stigmatization. in addition, the who and cdc guidelines highlight the importance of early detection, the isolation of cases, the appropriate use of personal protective equipment and communication with healthcare workers and the public. according to these guidelines, the contact precautions for mpox include the isolation of suspected or confirmed cases, the use of ppe and the implementation of strict hand-hygiene practices to minimize the risk of transmission. more specifically, contact and droplet precautions should be implemented for any suspected or confirmed patient with mpox as well as airborne precautions if aerosol-generating procedures are performed. furthermore, surfaces frequently used by the patient or where patient-care activities occur as well as patient-care equipment should be cleaned and disinfected, while fabric items such as linens, hospital gowns, towels and clothes should be carefully handled and collected. also, all bodily fluids and solid waste of patients with mpox should be treated as infectious waste. all patients with mpox should be advised to abstain from sex until all skin lesions have crusted, the scabs have fallen off and a fresh layer of skin has formed underneath. condoms should be consistently used during sexual activity for 12 weeks after recovery. isolation of the suspected or confirmed mpox cases, ideally in a room with negative pressure and social distancing, is needed to prevent transmission. additionally, it is important to avoid any direct contact with animals such as rodents and primates as well as exposure to blood and inadequately cooked meat. the quarantine of imported animals for at least 6 weeks should be implemented and laboratory research with live mpxv should be strictly regulated to minimize spill-over events. 8.2. vaccination vaccination remains one of the primary strategies for the prevention and control of mpox outbreaks. vaccinia-poxvirus-based vaccines were used throughout the 20th century to eradicate human smallpox epidemics. these vaccines provide cross-protective immunity against mpox, providing a protection of about 85%. this has led to the incorporation of vaccinia-virus-based vaccines in the control efforts for outbreaks. vaccine-induced immunity lasts for a long period of time as people vaccinated against smallpox > 25 years ago are still protected against mpox, while the incidence of mpox infections significantly increased 40 years after the discontinuation of smallpox vaccination campaigns. acam2000 is a second-generation live-attenuated vaccinia-based vaccine that was approved by the fda in august 2007 for individuals > 18 years of age to replace the older vaccinia-virus-based vaccines and it was used for mpox prevention. this vaccine is indicated for immunocompetent people and non-pregnant or non-breastfeeding people who are at a high risk of exposure. it is administered once by the percutaneous route using a bifurcated needle; a pustular-like skin reaction occurs at the injection site, forming a scab after 2–3 weeks. the acam2000 vaccine is effective against mpox infection; however, it can cause severe adverse effects such as myopericarditis, progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, post-vaccination encephalitis and severe fetal smallpox through vertical transmission. a modified vaccinia ankara vaccine, also known as jynneos in the usa, imvamune in canada or imvanex in europe, originated from the genetic modification of the vaccinia ankara–bavarian nordic virus grown in chicken embryo fibroblasts. it is a third-generation, live-attenuated, non-replicating viral vector vaccine that was approved by the fda in september 2019 and is indicated for the prevention of human smallpox and mpox in people over 18 years of age at a high risk of these infections. it is subcutaneously or intradermally administered in two doses at least 28 days apart. high immunogenicity and an excellent safety profile have been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials. since the 2022 outbreak, data on the effectiveness of a single-dose mva-bn show a moderate effect in preventing mpox infection. another third-generation live-attenuated replicating vaccine is lc16m8, which was derived from the lister strain of vaccinia and was licensed in japan for immunization against smallpox and mpox. studies have shown that lc16m8 is highly immunogenic against mpox, with a favorable safety profile. according to the who recommendations for vaccination strategies against mpxv infections, a primary preventive pre-exposure vaccination with third-generation non-replicating vaccines is only recommended for individuals at a high risk of exposure such as gay, bisexual or other msm with multiple sexual partners as well as sex workers, healthcare workers at a high risk of exposure, laboratory personnel working directly with any poxviruses and personnel designated by the health authorities who are directly involved in the treatment of and contact with possible mpox cases. mass vaccination is not currently required nor recommended for mpox. post-exposure preventive vaccination with a third-generation vaccine is recommended in the first 3–4 days of exposure and up to 14 days for the close contacts of infected people with a high risk of exposure, but if administered between days 4 to 14 post-exposure, the vaccine only minimizes the symptoms and does not prevent infection. it is worth noting that in immunocompetent individuals, the acam2000 vaccine can be also administered for post-exposure prevention. thus, vaccination against mpox may be an effective measure for the prevention or attenuation of the disease, controlling the epidemics of mpox along with other preventive measures such as contact precautions. 9. reinfection and post-vaccination infection although the duration of immunity provided by vaccination or a past infection is under investigation, an increasing number of case reports of possible mpox reinfections have been published since january 2023. for some of the possible reinfection cases, there is still a debate as to whether they are relapses of previous infections or not because confirmation from phylogenetic sequencing has not been possible. nevertheless, there is at least one case of reinfection that has been confirmed by whole-genome sequencing. the epidemiologic characteristics and risk factors for reinfection and post-vaccination infection show consistency with those described in the literature for primary mpox infections in the 2022 epidemic. sexually active msm reporting multiple sexual partners and condomless sexual intercourse compose the majority of these cases. of note, a significant proportion of the individuals diagnosed with reinfection or post-vaccination mpox infection had a concomitant sti. clinical manifestations of repeated or post-vaccination infections seem to differ from those reported in the 2022 outbreak in terms of the extent and severity. to date, no deaths have been reported among these cases, while the number of individuals who required hospitalization is limited. it is worth mentioning that more than 10% of the individuals diagnosed during the 2022 epidemic required hospitalization. in a global case series of individuals with repeated mpox infection, significantly fewer lesions were observed during reinfection compared with the initial infection and the time required for the resolution of symptoms was shorter. moreover, the extent of body involvement, the number of mucosal areas affected and analgesia requirement were lower during reinfection and none of the cases required hospitalization. when compared with repeat infections, individuals with infection after vaccination showed a less extensive involvement of extragenital areas and less analgesia requirement. in conclusion, the ever-increasing number of reinfection and breakthrough mpox cases underscores the importance of including mpox in the differential diagnosis of individuals with presumed immunity through recent infection or vaccination presenting with symptoms compatible with mpox. 10. global and community responses after the recognition of the first mpox cases in may 2022 in several non-endemic countries and the widespread epidemic that followed, a pheic was rapidly declared on 23 july 2022. to contain the spread of the disease, a rapid global response was warranted, capitalizing on the knowledge gained during the sars-cov-2 pandemic. the significance of international collaboration in terms of surveillance and data-sharing was immediately acknowledged. from the very beginning of the epidemic, information was collected and communicated in real time by the appropriate authorities/organizations, both at national and international levels. this led to the early identification of msm as the population most affected as well as the risk factors associated with this epidemic. as a result, sexual health clinics were on the frontline of this epidemic. the primary goal was the early detection of mpox cases so that timely isolation and contact tracing could take place. these interventions were necessary to reduce the spread of the virus. due to the possible stigmatizing features of the disease and given the lessons learned from the hiv epidemic, community involvement was deemed essential to cultivate trust, establish routes of communication and reach marginalized groups. several successful examples of community-led initiatives have been reported. early in the mpox outbreak in 2022, hiv/aids organizations in germany and transgender women’s groups in peru managed to reduce spread by raising awareness in the lgbtqi+ community, underlying the importance of community involvement. community engagement proved to be important in reducing stress and mpox-related stigma as well as distinguishing between real information and misinformation and conspiracy theories across social networks during the epidemic. moreover, at the beginning of this outbreak, a lack of trust in health systems among a significant proportion of the public after the experience of sars-cov-2 was still fresh. the cooperation of the state with community organizations managed to shift the sexual behavior of the population at risk to safer sexual practices, which ultimately contributed to limiting the epidemic. it seems that harm-reduction strategies and sex-positive messages were much more effective than the initial guidelines, which suggested strict abstinence. the final important pillar of the epidemic containment was the broad dispensing of available vaccines. pre- and post-exposure vaccination programs have played a key role in the strategies against mpox in north america and europe. unfortunately, the global response once again fell short of what was needed. early in the 2022 mpox global outbreak, access to vaccines was unequal across high- and low-income countries. the availability of vaccines in the african countries where the virus had been endemic for decades was negligible. on the other hand, high-income countries secured large supplies of mpox vaccines. in addition, as per august 2024, only two african countries had granted emergency use authorization for the mva-bn vaccine. as a result, during the current 2023–2024 outbreak originating in drc, the population of the affected regions was not vaccinated, favoring the rapid spread of the virus. this led international stakeholders to take measures, including the procurement and donation of hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses to affected countries. in order to facilitate timely and increased access to vaccines, the who proceeded with the prequalification approval of the mva-bn vaccine in september 2024. 11. challenges and future perspectives while the who declared the end of the pheic for mpox in may 2023, sustained transmission of the clade iib virus has been established in humans, so the risk of resurgence remains a real public health threat, especially considering the current outbreak in african countries. moreover, clinicians should be aware that previous infection and vaccination do not preclude mpox and they should investigate further when clinical suspicion is high. data support the importance of vaccination and the recommendation that people who are at a high risk of mpxv infection should be prioritized to receive the mpox vaccine. this approach requires global vaccine availability in the areas historically affected by mpox and also in newly affected countries where access is limited. in the context of vaccine shortages when the number of those at risk exceeds vaccine availability, dose-sparing strategies or administration of at least a single dose of the vaccine to provide more widespread population coverage should be considered. the protection of immunosuppressed people, including people with advanced hiv disease, through vaccination also represents a highly relevant area for research and for policymakers. immune responses and immunity against clade iib mpxv are areas of active research, while phylogenetic and epidemiological analyses as well as randomized clinical trials are urgently needed. there is also a need to bolster public health surveillance so that relevant public health agencies are notified of cases of suspected relapse, reinfection and breakthrough infection to further inform policies and guidelines. for this to be accomplished, a unified, country-driven strategy with decentralized laboratories properly equipped to enhance their sequencing capacity should be adopted. the development of point-of-care tests would enable better, large-scale testing within a reasonable timeframe. the adaptation of an integrated, individualized and evidence-based management of cases, with a focus on the research and development of new treatment strategies and options, can lead to better prognosis and reduced morbidity and mortality. finally, future public health interventions and campaigns should engage key populations and communities to ensure greater acceptance and credibility of implemented policies. focusing on providing community-led structures with the authority and capacity to act is a proven strategy that can reduce costs and optimize efficacy.
mpox virus as a global public health emergency: a scoping review abstract the monkeypox virus has emerged as a global public health emergency of international concern recently. the virus that was endemic in west and central africa has now been reported with chains of global transmission to several countries. a scoping review was carried out from the relevant literature available from pubmed, scopus and web of science. this comprehensive analysis describes the virus epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, complications including secondary bacterial infections, diagnosis, treatment and vaccination. the article underscores the significance of key viral and immune mediators of infection and discusses updated recommendations on therapeutic strategies and vaccination. 1. introduction monkeypox virus is a double-stranded dna virus belonging to the genus orthopoxvirus of the family poxviridae and causes zoonotic infections. mpox was declared a global public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization, geneva, in august 2024. the virus appears to have been primarily confined to the tropical rainforest regions of central and western africa. having remained largely unrecognized until 1760, the first description of the infection originated from monkeys of the brazilian forest showing lesions akin to smallpox pustules followed by several reports during 1850–70. the virus was placed within the group of poxviruses in 1959. the first confirmed global outbreak of mpox was reported in denmark in 1958 among cynomolgus monkeys imported from singapore followed by outbreaks documented in the netherlands, the united states, the philippines, malaysia and certain other countries. nevertheless, as the infections were largely confined among primates, the absence of human infections during these outbreaks misled the transmissibility of the virus, and humans were considered nonsusceptible. the mpox virus was antigenically related to other poxviruses including smallpox, cowpox, camelpox, buffalopox and rabbitpox viruses as reported in the 1960s, based on morphology, nature of inclusion bodies, clinical manifestations and serological reactions. the pathogenesis largely resembled smallpox and cowpox except the cutaneous haemorrhagic lesions that are produced in rabbits. subsequently, human mpox virus infection was reported in six individuals between late 1970 and early 1971 across three different west african regions. at least four of these were confirmed with culture, hemagglutination and neutralizing titres with the poxvirus group. this confirmed the susceptibility of humans to mpox and that vaccination against smallpox gave protection against mpox. during the same time, at least five species of rodents were found to be susceptible to mpox virus, of which rabbits and white mice were highly susceptible, as the mpox-specific antibodies were detectable in these species for over a year. when the smallpox eradication programme ended in africa, sporadic outbreaks of mpox infection were documented from the tropical rainforest regions of central and west africa. the animal reservoir of these infections remains essentially undiscovered, and most of the patients with documented mpox had been in close contact with unvaccinated individuals. a specific large outbreak in different regions of zaire during 1980–1985 among all age groups led to the revival of surveillance programs on zoonotic diseases and presumed human-to-human transmission. this outbreak also confirmed that mpox infection occurred largely among unvaccinated contacts. the virus emergence and re-emergence in zaire served as a model to study the disease pattern, incidence and attack rates, disease surveillance and establishment of laboratory diagnosis modalities such as elisa for the detection of neutralizing antibodies. the genomic compositions for smallpox, cowpox and mpox were first reported in 1990 and revealed considerable similarity in genomic regions that determine the host range. the evolution of pcr assays helped in differentiating further as distinct sequences among the poxviruses. in 2000, mpox was declared a potential biowarfare agent, and the mpox infection was considered an emerging zoonotic disease with public health importance, and several antiviral drugs were reviewed for likely repurposing and patient management. the infection was considered endemic in the rodent population in parts of west africa. in 2003, imported rodents, exotic pets and prairie dogs that were used in hunting caused an outbreak in different regions of the united states. the imported rodents included african rope squirrels, tree squirrels, african giant pouched rats, brush-tailed porcupines, dormice and striped mice. the smallpox vaccine helped prevent the spread of orthopox viruses and even outweighed the neurological complications the vaccine can give rise to as a side effect. considering the surge in human-to-human transmission rates, especially among close contacts and healthcare workers, following the global lack of smallpox vaccination, the mpox virus was placed on the red alert list, leading to a revival of antiviral therapies and vaccination programs. the first immunological evidence of protection against the mpox virus by the smallpox vaccine focussed only on cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies but not cell-mediated immune responses. later, the cd8+ t-cells were reported to complement the antibody-mediated viral killing necessary for developing resistance against the infection. the mpox virus was distinguished as two distinct clades: clades i and ii. the virus types that are identified in central africa, especially in the democratic republic of congo, were categorized as clade i, which primarily afflicted children and adolescents. the virus types that caused an outbreak in 2003 in the united states were categorized as clade iia and those that caused the 2017–2019 mpox outbreak in nigeria and the 2022 global outbreak were labelled as clade iib. during this global outbreak, the clade iib mpox caused ∼99,000 confirmed cases and approximately 170 deaths in more than 117 countries. 2. epidemiology 2.1. prevalence data-global trends the mpox virus has become the most common and aggressive orthopoxvirus in the human population after the smallpox virus that was successfully eradicated in 1979. in the backdrop of waning immunity to the smallpox virus attributed to the global stop of vaccination, there is a universally acceptable consensus on the resurgence of related viruses. in 2022, sporadic cases of mpox from different countries outside of africa were reported including the united kingdom, the united states, singapore and israel. most of them had a travel history to endemic areas or contact with individuals diagnosed with mpox. the mpox virus strains were identified as variant clade i, which is considered to have a low fatality rate. soon, countries including portugal followed by canada, spain and other european countries such as belgium, sweden, germany, france, canary islands, the netherlands and italy reported a surge in mpox cases. the who declared by mid-2023 a ‘pheic' considering the large outbreaks in several countries. by the end of 2023, the outbreak amplified exponentially to as high as 58,000 laboratory-confirmed cases and 20 deaths that spread to asian countries including hong kong, china, the philippines and taiwan. currently, an alarming escalation in the global incidence of mpox infections is being reported. between 1 january 2022 and 31 july 2024, the total reported mpox cases from 121 member states across all six who regions are 103,048 laboratory-confirmed cases and 229 deaths as per the who recent report. it is interesting to note that the majority of mpox-infected and mpox-related deaths documented were from regions that had no historical reports. the mpox impact in the west and central africa corresponded to historical reports. this indicates that the reported sporadic cases during this outbreak are mostly linked to travel history and animals imported from the endemic regions. the most affected countries globally since january 2022 include the united states, brazil, spain, democratic republic of congo, france, colombia, mexico, the united kingdom, peru and germany. all these countries account for 80% of the cases reported, globally as per the who. among the confirmed cases, african americans were highly affected followed by hispanics or latinos, whites and asians. the global trend also indicated that men aged 31 to 35 years are affected to a higher extent compared to other gender and age groups. the endemic mpox infection peaks generally during the months of may and june and is the lowest from august to october. in the usa, as of mid-january 2024, 32,063 cases and 58 deaths have been reported due to mpox clade ii subtype. california reported the highest number of cases followed by new york, texas, florida and georgia. a vast majority of the populations in these locations were either unvaccinated or had received only one dose of the smallpox vaccine. in the united states, the 2022 outbreak of clade i mpox viruses ended with ∼30,000 confirmed cases. the 2024 outbreak was caused by the clade ii virus, which is responsible for the ongoing worldwide outbreak since july 2024. the first mpox case in the who southeast asian region was reported from india in july 2022, and this was an individual who had a travel history to the middle east. in a period of two to three months, at least 20 mpox cases were reported thereafter from across different parts of southeast asia, predominantly from india followed by thailand and indonesia. in july 2024, three major states of the democratic republic of congo—burundi, rwanda and uganda—reported confirmed cases with clade i mpox viruses. although the viruses are endemic in these regions, the outbreak was more widespread across neighbouring countries and has led to stringent public health measures for prevention and response. clade i is reported to be associated with a higher rate of severe disease as compared to clade ii. the outbreaks that were reported from different countries from 1958 to 2023 are listed in table 1, and the recent outbreaks in 2024 are shown in figure 2. 2.2. zoonotic transmission primarily being a zoonotic disease, the natural animal reservoirs of the mpox virus largely remain enigmatic. the initial detection of mpox in diseased monkeys was followed by rope and sun squirrels and other wild rodents. the infected animal likely shows symptoms such as fever, rashes, lethargy, loss of appetite, coughing, bloating, nasal/eye secretions and skin blisters. although many mammals could be susceptible to mpox, there are very limited data available on the complete viral host range. the susceptibility among the species or varieties or strains that can affect each animal species largely remains ambiguous. a retrospective observational study on animal reservoirs indicated four animal species including the african striped squirrel, african dormouse and gambian pouched rat acting as major animal reservoirs for mpox. humans acquire mpox infection from animals through direct contact with the body fluids, ingestion of infected or contaminated meat, animal bites and scratches. the virus is transmitted from infected humans through direct skin or lesion contact, respiratory droplets or large water droplets during prolonged face-to-face and sexual contact. furthermore, transmission can also occur via fomites contaminated with infectious material derived from infected lesions. vertical transmission from the infected mother is not clear, but adverse foetal outcome was reported in an infected mother. a recent meta-analysis indicated a high prevalence of mpox dna in seminal fluids, indicating the potential role of sexual transmission. the rate of pcr positivity was higher in skin samples followed by anogenital/rectal samples, but lower in nasopharyngeal, urine and blood/plasma samples. during the 2022 outbreak, 91% of the infected individuals tested positive for mpox virus in their seminal fluids. however, horizontal transmission through genital secretions during sexual activity remains unclear despite the evidence of infections acquired following sexual contact. there is also considerable evidence that mpox infection inflicts a considerable degree of tissue damage in the rectal compartment, leading to severe proctitis. the use of experimental animal models represents a key strategy for studying the transmission dynamics and pathophysiology of mpox virus infection in animals. despite the serological and molecular evidence of virus infection in certain animals is it important to use correct models. the prairie dog model resulted in similar pathological changes characterized by skin lesions and lymphoid tissue necrosis as seen in humans. viral shedding was higher in the nasal secretions of the infected animals followed by spleen and cutaneous lesions. the lymphatic spread followed by hematogenous spread occurred resulting in secondary viremia. the squirrel model showed similar results in the viral shedding being the highest in the oral secretions but did not reveal the involvement of the liver or spleen. the gambian pouched rat model indicated the highest viral shedding in oral secretions and indicated clinical signs of the disease. 2.3. travel-associated mpox outbreaks the democratic republic of congo recorded a high outbreak in 2023 with clade i mpox followed by the other outbreak in april 2024 with the same clade. international travel and social gatherings play an important role in mpox transmission and so the neighbouring countries of the democratic republic of congo are at a high risk of mpox infection outbreaks. hitherto, the countries bordering the eastern parts of the democratic republic of congo including burundi, rwanda and uganda have reported several cases of outbreaks due to clade i mpox suggesting transmission to neighbouring countries. mpox vaccination has been recommended for people at risk, which includes the unvaccinated population, pregnant women, neonates, individuals with other skin infections and immunocompromised individuals. owing to the travel restrictions including commercial vehicles from and to the democratic republic of congo, the risk of spread is limited. nevertheless, infection prevention and control as per the centre for disease control and prevention guidelines are provided to reduce the risk of transmission and management of travel-associated mpox. travel to an afflicted country along with the onset of illness within 21 days of travel is considered an important epidemiologic criterion for probable disease confirmation. vaccination recommendations, enhanced surveillance and public health measures play a key role in the mitigation of emerging mpox. travel to the countries that reported mpox cases requires vaccination with a commercial jynneos or acam2000 vaccine completed, with two doses at least 28 days apart. the second dose can be administered sooner if the individual is at risk. however, the spread of mpox cases with no evident travel links to any endemic areas, contact tracing and measures of infection severity are key epidemiological metrics, and even if challenging, it is essential to establish the public health policy. 2.4. genomic variants the viral genome is a double-stranded dna of about 196,858 base pairs in length coding for > 200 genes. the central part of the genome of about 101 kb is flanked by variable regions and inverted terminal repeats. the central region possesses conserved sequences coding for essential functions including transcription, replication, structural proteins and enzymes. the virus shows antigenic similarities with other orthopox viruses, which provide cross-protection. microevolution is believed to have emerged as a cause of hypermutations induced by apolipoprotein b mrna–editing catalytic polypeptide-like 3, the enzyme that mediates cytidine deamination to uracil and also plays a vital role in antiviral immunity. the mutations in the specific viral dna motifs could have implications for the evolutionary potential of mpox during the outbreak. the difference in the virulence and transmission between the two mpox clades are studied as it is vital for developing appropriate therapeutic strategies. the clade i mpox closely aligned with smallpox virus infections. clade i was reported as the causative agent of a more severe form of the disease, mostly affecting the smallpox-unvaccinated group. clades i and iia were mostly endemic, but the clade iib infections occurred across the countries including the nonendemic regions with varied clinical presentation. clade ii is connected to the transmission among sexual contacts especially among high-risk individuals such as men who have sex with men and people living with hiv. clade ii mpox viruses also have a high human-to-human transmission without any apparent zoonotic link. clade i mpox cases were primarily among children and young men and had a high zoonotic transmission link. the genetic characteristics of clade iib that separate it from clade i and clade iia should be considered for further investigation on unique mpox transmission potential. mpox clade i showed increased virulence with 2-logs higher lethal dose than clade ii in animal models. significant differences in virulence were also observed among the mpox clades with different routes of infection. the gene variations between clades i and ii that contribute to the severity of the transmission potential of the virus are not clearly understood, but it is believed that variable genes such as opg195, b14r and opg032 determine functions including host range, virulence and immunomodulation. furthermore, the identical but inverted repeats of 6.4 kb sequences flanking at each end of the mpox genome play a major role in immune evasion and host range. insertion and expansion of inverted dna repeats in the mpox virus were reported to be a major factor in an outbreak in germany. case-fatality ratio associated with clade i is about 10%, while clade ii has a cfr of around 1%. compared to clade i, the genes d14l, d15l, d16l and d17l are lost and the genes d4l, b14l and b15l are curtailed in clade ii. in addition, genes n3r, n2r, n1r and r1r that are present in clade iia are absent in clades i and iib. the role of these genetic changes in the pathogenesis mechanism is so far unknown. 3. immunopathogenesis 3.1. pathophysiology the virus enters the host through various routes such as the mucosa overlying the oropharynx, nasopharynx, ocular, rectal and genitourinary tracts, and the skin. although the virus primarily affects the lymphoid tissue, it has a broad cell tropism and therefore can afflict multiple organs. the specific host cell receptors that mediate virus entry are not clearly defined, but virulence factors such as the mpox inhibitor of complement enzymes, a 24-kda secretory protein and its homologue, complement control protein are reported to modulate the host range and tissue tropism. mopice is expressed by the highly virulent strains of clade i, while clade ii lacks this protein. this protein is also found to modulate adaptive immune responses in the host. similar proteins that appear in variola and vaccinia viruses are called smallpox inhibitors of complement enzymes and vaccinia complement control protein, respectively. these proteins regulate the human complement system, and their dimeric forms act as major virulence factors. these proteins show significant differences in their efficiency among the poxviruses. this could be a major factor determining the host range, infectivity and transmission potential of different poxviruses. these complement regulators and other virulence factors such as il-1 binding protein, b10r, b14r, b19r, d10l and d14l could play a vital role in the pathogenesis and tissue tropism. further studies on the differences in the structural and functional motifs of these proteins could help with our understanding of the broad tissue and host tropisms of mpox viruses. the virus possibly uses multiple ligands to interact with the cell surface receptors, which may also explain the broad animal and human host cell tropism and the challenges in the identification of specific receptors used by the virus to infect. multiple receptors including heparan sulphate, glycosaminoglycans and chondroitin have been reported to mediate virus entry. the viral genome expresses 25 membrane proteins that are species-specific and contribute to the pathogenesis based on their presence or modifications in these proteins. the membrane proteins vary in composition within the two distinct infectious poxvirus particles viz. extracellular enveloped virions and intracellular enveloped virions. after gaining cellular entry, early, intermediate and late viral mrna synthesis occurs followed by protein synthesis. the infectious virions are assembled and become an iev as it is encased within a bilayer membrane generated from the golgi complex including golgi-associated retrograde protein and conserved oligomeric golgi complex. these also play a vital role in virus–host interaction and are part of the formation of eevs for a successful egress process. 3.2. immune response and host interactions the virus entry into a susceptible host cell is mediated by cog complex proteins. these proteins assist viral fusion and mediate the virus entry and early gene expression. the viral-induced host immune response may play a significant role in the disease pathogenesis. the disseminated mpox infection activates a strong immune response involving multiple organs including lymphoid organs. the viruses also possess unique immune evasion strategies, leading to an increase in prevalence rates among vulnerable animal and human populations, and one of these strategies is the viral evasion of tlr3 signalling and through the downregulation of cytokines and chemokines such as tnf-α, il-1α and ccl5. the innate immune responses act as the first line of defence and include cells such as monocytes and natural killer cells and innate factors such as type i interferons and inflammatory cytokines. adaptive immunity plays a substantial role in virus clearance and long-term protection. the efficacy of the nk cells is hampered by downregulating the chemokine receptors such as ccr2, ccr5, ccr7, cxcr3 and cx3cr1 required for nk cell migration. the most notable innate mechanism activated is the cgas-sting/mita pathway. the pathway mediates immune responses against many dna viruses, bacteria, parasites, autoimmune diseases and cancers. this pathway has emerged as a crucial element of innate antiviral immunity. the viral f17 protein interferes with the cgas-sting/mita signalling pathway and sequesters the regulators of mammalian targets of rapamycin complexes mtorc1 and mtorc2 and through other nuclease enzymes termed as ‘poxins' that cleave 2′3′-cgamp to control cgas-sting/mita signalling. many other viral genes including vaccinia virus protein 018 and e3 protein inhibit ifn-signalling pathways, and f14 protein disrupts nf-κb activation. regarding viral effects on the activation of the adaptive response, the m2 protein and a35 protein disrupt antigen presentation, t-cell priming, and chemokine synthesis and function together in modulating the host immune responses. 4. clinical manifestations 4.1. pathological features following an incubation period of 9.5 days, the virus replicates in the local inoculation site and spreads to local lymph nodes. the symptom onset resembles smallpox infection with early symptoms of painful lesions with fever and other prodromal syndromes that last for 1–4 days including chills and lymphadenopathy. moreover, the symptom of myalgia occurs either before or after the appearance of lesions. lymphadenopathy is considered an important clinical manifestation and the pathognomonic sign of mpox that could help distinguish it from other orthopoxvirus infections and other skin diseases. rashes appear within 3 days of fever, and the common skin sites include the face, chest, arms, legs, genitals, anorectals, palms, soles, mouth and eyes. the rash is predominantly monomorphic in a centrifugal distribution and develops into vesicular and pustular lesions that last for 5–7 days; thereafter, they become crusts and peel off within a 15–22-day period. based on the skin lesions, the severity score can be classified as mild, moderate, severe and very severe. hospitalization is not required in most cases, the treatment largely includes attentive monitoring, antiviral therapy and management of secondary infections and associated complications. 4.2. other manifestations mpox is foremost a self-limiting disease but can give extended clinical manifestations involving multisystems, which are associated with fatal outcomes, especially among the high-risk groups. immunocompromised individuals, individuals with pre-existing skin eczema, and children and hiv infection are considered risk groups for developing life-threatening mpox. mpox can, apart from giving vesiculopustular lesions on the skin and oral mucosa, cause oral, ocular and neurological manifestations, acute renal injury, fulminant myocarditis leading to pericardial effusion, and pericarditis and lymphadenitis in the cervical, submandibular and inguinal regions. oral manifestations primarily are based on sexual behaviour and mainly present sore throat, ulcers, vesicles and dysphagia. signs and symptoms in the pharynx or oropharynx, especially the tonsils, tongue and perioral site, are predominantly reported followed by lips and palate. the key clinical features resemble other viral and bacterial infections such as herpes viruses, coxsackie viruses and streptococcus pneumoniae, presenting oral lesions with sore throat and should be considered for differential diagnosis. it is noteworthy that the appearance of oral lesions following sexual contact should be considered highly suspicious as they were increasingly observed among individuals who had oral sex with mpox-infected individuals. anogenital lesions and skin rashes with lymphadenopathy were predominantly seen among the infected during the 2022 outbreak. other sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis and gonorrhoea should be considered for differential diagnosis as these pathogens cause pharyngeal infections as well as maculopapular lesions in the genitals along with fever and lymphadenopathy. the neurological symptoms range from mild headache and myalgia to encephalitis. more severe cases presented decreased general responsiveness, rigidity and bilateral babinski signs, which are common neurological presentations associated with many neurodegenerative diseases and pathogens infecting the central nervous system. apart from these, mpox-associated ocular infections can lead to keratitis and conjunctivitis, and this can lead to decreased vision. 4.3. secondary bacterial infections several bacterial pathogens mimic mpox infection due to their clinical manifestations and could result in underreporting or misdiagnosis, which could further increase morbidity and mortality or predispose to outbreaks. secondary bacterial infections occur with mpox with a prevalence of 30%–75% and are further complicated by increasing the severity of mpox infection. notably, pharyngeal coinfections with group a streptococci have been frequently reported during the 2022 outbreak. the infected patients exhibited posterior oropharyngeal erythema, uvula oedema and vesicular lesion on the epiglottis. these patients respond to antibiotics but require lengthy hospitalization with serious complications. it is therefore important for clinicians to monitor for oropharyngeal manifestations especially when corticosteroids are administered. moreover, streptococcus infection in hiv-infected has been reported with multimucosal involvement and systemic infection, indicating its importance among patients with comorbidities. patients with secondary bacterial sepsis during mpox infection succumb to polymicrobial infection, septic shock with multiorgan involvement, and death. the secondary bacterial infections could be mild and localized but can become complicated if early identification and clinical management are not done with appropriate antibiotics. mpox-associated genital lesions are commonly seen in patients infected with sexually transmitted infections. these infections lead to further complications such as rectitis and proctitis in men and infertility in women. msm usually presents lesions in the anogenital areas and frequently reports coinfections with neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis and treponema pallidum. coinfection with such sexually transmitted pathogens results in delayed clearance of mpox, leading to prolonged viral shedding and decelerating therapeutic drug response. 4.4. at-risk populations people living in the endemic regions of africa, or neighbouring areas, and individuals having close contact with the affected communities have a high risk of acquiring the disease. close physical contact including sexual and nonsexual interactions is of serious concern, especially in the adult population. the lack of or incomplete smallpox vaccination is a major factor associated with mpox. prior immunization for smallpox is reported to protect from mpox with up to 80.7% efficacy and decreases the risk 5.2-fold. according to the european cdc, the overall risk of the disease is low; however, among high-risk groups such as those underlying immunocompromised conditions due to hiv infection, pregnant women and newborns are reported with moderate or high risk. the other risk factors include handling, hunting and consuming rodents, contact with wildlife, shared drinking, sleeping and eating and coinfection with large skin lesions, patients lacking sufficient data and patients with chronic skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and acute skin conditions such as burns. 5. transmission dynamics 5.1. simulation model and parameter estimation estimation of transmission potential from the high-risk group, men having sex with men to non-msm was analysed using a multigroup dynamic model. the possibility of contact mpox infection from an individual with a high-risk sexual behaviour was less than 10−5, the cumulative incidence rate was about 6 × 10−8, the required vaccine coverage was 80%, and the simulated r0 was 2.13. a recent study analysed transmission dynamics through mathematical modelling among different high-risk sexual behaviour groups including msm, gay and bisexual individuals. the study indicated an incubation period of 6.9 days and r0 ranging from 1.41 to 2.17. the study also showed msm to be the group with the highest risk and emphasized the efficacy of vaccination in reducing the rate of infection. sexual transmission is reported to be the major route of spread compared to nonsexual contact transmission such as through respiratory particles and contaminated surfaces. during the 2022 outbreak, among different modes of transmission, male-to-male sexual contact had been the most significant mode that appears to have increased the risk of disease acquisition. this could be possibly due to certain sociobehavioural correlates in the population. another study identified the superspreader gatherings and sexual networks particularly among msms as a major risk factors for the spread of mpox. the time-discrete susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model estimated r0 of 2.25 to 2.7 when different factors including travel history, exposure settings and transmission routes were analysed. a systematic review of mathematical models on mpox transmission indicates several parameters including human-to-human contact/transmission rate, progression rate, recovery rate and death rate. the study reported an r0 of 0.3 and an effective reproduction number re of 0.08. mpox cases are considerably higher among msms due to their specific sexual patterns. this includes having sexual contact with multiple partners, engaging in interconnected sexual networks and sexual events such as chemsex parties and social stigma associated with msm significantly. these markedly increase the risk of mpox disease transmission. massive super spreading events are linked to crowding within confined spaces, repeated or new sexual contact and coinfections such as hiv. another study showed the potential increase in mpox spread in the population associated with hiv endemicity. mpox spread has been reported to increase in the presence of hiv and is therefore applicable to msm population. among msms, the presence of primary lesions in the external genitalia and anus and subsequent contact with the lesions during the sexual practices further facilitate the disease transmission within the msm population. a bayesian susceptible-infected-recovered model was used to estimate the transmission dynamics, which showed an r0 of 0.817 to 2.251 with an infectious period of 8.5 days. the ratio of r0 and effective reproductive number ranged from 1 to 1.46 and indicated the required vaccine coverage of 37%. the re value indicates the average number of secondary cases per infectious case in both susceptible and protected populations, while r0 indicates the number of persons infected by infectious persons in the susceptible population. the values of both r0 and re help in predicting a pandemic outbreak using contact-tracing data and mathematical models. hence, these different mathematical models indicate varied r0 and re values that make prediction more unreliable and clearly demonstrate that it is important to include several epidemiological factors to calculate an accurate prediction of transmission dynamics. 6. outbreak management mpox represents a significant public health concern and warrants a robust public health initiative on emergency response management targeting enhanced preparedness, rapid diagnosis, strengthened epidemiological surveys, effective interventions and vaccination. the korean disease control and prevention agency had recommended pre-exposure prophylaxis for high-risk groups. the standard care during the mpox outbreak situation could begin with individual testing and assessment to determine the risk group/s and the requirement of hospitalization, if not home isolation will be adequate. these cases shall undergo testing by pcr. patients presenting severe illness or posing a risk to others should be immediately notified to public health for appropriate infection control. the pcr-negative patients shall be advised to undergo rest and isolation if the symptoms are evident and look for other differential diagnoses. the who guidelines on the management of mpox patients among high-risk groups recommend management with optimized supportive care interventions. recommendations on the prevention and control measures are provided by the cdc for patients in a healthcare setting. this includes additional precautions to prevent transmission with appropriate infection control practices in place, patients placed in individual rooms, use of personal protective equipment and waste management. environmental infection control in healthcare facilities including soiled linens, clothing and bedding are handled following the specific guidelines of the cdc with special care as they are implicated in disease transmission. among the healthcare workers, infection prevention measures should be implemented including hand hygiene, training on standard procedures on the use of ppe and provision of special care for pregnant and immunosuppressed individuals. alongside standard infection control practices, patient isolation or self-isolation, use of ppe, personal hygiene, waste management and other environmental infection control protocols are advocated. the use of epa-registered hospital-grade disinfectant with potential antiviral property, appropriate handling of soiled linens/surfaces and avoidance of activities such as sharing clothing, dry-dusting and sweeping have been recommended in the guidelines. postexposure assessment of risk including 21-day monitoring period shall be followed in accordance with the recommended guidelines. the current outbreak indicates a deficiency in sufficient and quick response to infections with the potential to cause outbreaks. the clinical outcomes for individuals in high-risk groups are of serious concern. asian and oceania countries with extremely concentrated and connected sexual contact networks are more vulnerable to transmission and require urgent management strategies to prevent outbreaks among them. necessary screening and evaluation for sexually transmitted infections including hiv testing along with health education and improved accessibility should be a priority for substantial improvement in prevention and treatment. 7. diagnosis and treatment 7.1. diagnostic assays immediate testing for mpox should be conducted on any suspected case. the result should be interpreted after careful consideration of associated clinical and epidemiological factors for assessing the likelihood of infection. due to the atypical presentation of skin rashes, a diagnosis could be challenging, and hence, it is important to consider potential causes of skin rashes and differential diagnosis. the appropriate clinical specimen for diagnostic confirmation includes skin lesion material such as swabs of lesion exudate, roofs of multiple lesions or lesion crust from the suspected cases. the collected swabs should be placed in a viral transport medium, and preferably, samples from lesions, crusts and vesicular fluids should be collected in separate tubes. depending on the clinical presentation and availability of sufficient viral genomic material from the lesion, additional specimens including urine, semen, genital and rectal swabs and blood samples could be considered especially during acute viremia. it is recommended to collect the sample preferably during the prodromal phase and lesions during the macular stage by trained personnel. in the case of neurological involvement, pcr on csf specimens should be considered. pcr is the recommended confirmatory test for either generic identification of orthopox viruses or specific mpox viruses. viral culture is not recommended for a routine diagnostic procedure. additional sequencing techniques might provide additional information on virus clade useful for epidemiological purposes. 7.2. antiviral drugs there is no approved treatment for mpox infections available, but tecovirimat or tpoxx, a potent antiviral drug approved by the fda for the treatment of smallpox was used successfully during the 2022 outbreak. the efficacy of tecovirimat has been shown specifically beneficial, especially among high-risk groups, but this drug is not recommended for a mild infection. a reduction in the duration of mpox lesions in children and adults was not achieved by the drug for mpox infections caused by clade i viruses; nevertheless, it significantly reduced the mortality rate from 3.6% to 1.7%. the drug did not show any adverse effects, was tolerated well, and improved the clinical outcome at different scales of clinical severity. to note, tecovirimat is still at the experimental stage being tested for its safety and efficacy for mpox. the study of tecovirimat for mpox is ongoing, and the result from this clinical trial is expected to be available soon. additional strategies such as a combination of tecovirimat with other antiviral or antibiotics should be considered to treat specific or clinical manifestations such as systemic infections, and ocular and oral infections. brincidofovir, a prodrug of cidofovir is being used to treat severe cases of smallpox disease and has shown to be effective against mpox viruses as well. the drug is recommended for adults and neonates who do not respond well to tecovirimat, are severely immunodeficient, or report severe disease or a high risk of progression to severe disease. vaccinia immune globulin intravenous is a licenced treatment for vaccinia-vaccine-induced complications. this therapy can be considered as prophylaxis for severely immunocompromised individuals or can be used in addition to tecovirimat or brincidofovir treatment of mpox. 7.3. vaccine research advocacy for vaccination against the orthopox viruses dates back to 1798 when edward jenner demonstrated immunogenicity and cross-protection by cowpox virus against smallpox virus. dryvax was the first-generation smallpox vaccine, which was used globally and withdrawn in 2008. the acam2000, a second-generation live vaccine, is in use for certain at-risk populations. the jynneos vaccine based on the modified vaccinia ankara-bavarian nordic is a live attenuated, third-generation, smallpox vaccine developed by bavarian nordic, denmark. a single dose of mva-bn is recommended for adults and is shown to be highly effective among high-risk sexual contact populations. apart from adults, the vaccine is highly effective in inducing humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in children as well. a systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of mva-bn indicate 75% efficacy with a single dose and up to 80% efficacy with a two-dose vaccine. a single vaccination also showed high efficacy in protection as pre-exposure prophylaxis in hiv of a high-risk spanish cohort population. the jynneos is administered subcutaneously in a two-dose series 1 month apart or as a two-dose series as intradermal routes of administration. 8. conclusions during the global health emergency, it is of utmost importance to focus on pandemic preparedness, efficient management of epidemics and strengthening international ties for combined efforts in diagnosis, treatment and prevention. to implement the appropriate and effective countermeasures against emerging viruses, there is a need to enhance the laboratory testing facilities with wider testing platforms towards early detection. considering the growing number of afflicted populations, joint international action for coordinated measures through evidence-based national and international policy guidelines. several challenges remain in implementing public health policies, especially in resource-limited settings and regions with socioethnic issues. reinforced surveillance measures, multisector partnerships, prophylactic measures, capacity strengthening, tackling social stigma, guaranteeing fair access to vaccines and healthcare services are a few strategies that can help overcome these obstacles. isolation, active monitoring of high-risk individuals and effective vaccination strategies are the key public health measures to be implemented. future research focussing on the long-term clinical impact of mpox, outbreak preparedness, enhanced diagnostics and effective vaccines is imperative. the use of the two vaccines recommended by the who advisory group of experts on immunization and national regulatory bodies shall be accelerated for all countries, especially for lower-income countries. a such harmonized battle along with public health professionals, similar to the handling of covid-19 pandemic, could help mitigate mpox infection successfully.
mpox: global epidemic situation and countermeasures abstract mpox, is a zoonotic disease caused by the monkeypox virus and is primarily endemic to africa. as countries gradually stop smallpox vaccination, resistance to the smallpox virus is declining, increasing the risk of infection with mpox and other viruses. on 14 august 2024, the world health organization announced that the spread of mpox constituted a public health emergency of international concern. mpox’s transmission routes and symptoms are complex and pose new challenges to global health. several vaccines and antiviral drugs have been developed and marketed to prevent and control this disease. this review aims to introduce the epidemic situation, epidemiological characteristics, physiological and pathological characteristics, and preventive measures for mpox in detail, to provide a scientific basis for the prevention and control of mpox viruses worldwide. introduction in 1958, an unknown disease characterized by small pox-like blisters on the skin spread in a group of monkeys in africa. danish virologists isolated this new virus during their research and named it monkeypox virus. mpxv belongs to the genus orthopoxvirus in the family poxviridae and can cause zoonotic disease. because mpxv is resistant to low temperatures and dryness and can survive for several months in soil, scabs, and clothing, researchers have speculated that the primary hosts of mpxv are primates and african rodents. in 1970, in the democratic republic of congo, a nine-month-old child was infected with mpxv and exhibited symptoms similar to smallpox. although smallpox has been eradicated, different subtypes of the smallpox virus have similar genetic and antigenic properties, and infection with one may produce antibodies against other subtypes. furthermore, human mpxv infection has always been considered a rare and self-limiting disease, and has received little attention. however, the resistance of the population to different viruses has gradually weakened with the cessation of smallpox vaccination in various countries. in recent years, against the background that the general population has started a secondary infection with the novel coronavirus, the number and geographical distribution of human cases infected with mpxv have significantly increased. mpxv is divided into two main genetic clades: clade i, distributed in central africa, and clade ii, unique to west africa. clade i is further subdivided into sub-clades ia and ib, whereas clade ii is subdivided into sub clades iia and iib. these clades vary in their modes of transmission, pathogenicity, and clinical manifestations. clade i human infection is similar to typical smallpox and is characterized by symptoms such as fever, headache, and discomfort. compared to clade ii, clade i exhibits higher transmissibility and virulence, leading to more severe disease manifestations and higher mortality rates. the mortality rate of clade i is as high as 10 %, whereas that of clade iia is lower. unlike clades i and iia, clade iib exhibits increased human-to-human transmission capability. between 2022 and 2023, mpox outbreaks worldwide were mainly caused by strains of evolutionary clade iib. the outbreak of this epidemic began in 2022 and continues to the present day, with particularly significant impacts on some african countries. since may 2022, a series of global outbreaks involving clade iib have been recognized by the world health organization as public health emergencies of international concern, marking the launch of global prevention and control mechanisms. in august 2022, the number of reported cases peaked globally, making this period the most severe and tense stage of the epidemic. the epidemic has rapidly escalated. as of 20 september 2022, a total of 19 827 confirmed cases have been reported in 29 european union countries, including some european countries and non-traditional measles epidemic areas such as the united states. because the who announced on 12 may 2023, that the mpox outbreak was a public health emergency of international concern, this epidemic is far from over. in sharp contrast to this decision, the infection status of sub-clades ia and ib in clade i has significantly increased in the drc and other african countries, indicating the continued threat of these viral clades to public health in these countries. recent studies have shown a significant increase in mpox cases caused by clade i between 2023 and 2024, with the disease severity being higher than that of clade ii. the drc reported many clade i mpox cases in 2024, including the first case in kinshasa, raising concerns about global transmission. as of august 2024, the clade ib strain has been detected in multiple countries outside africa, indicating that the spread of the mpxv is gradually increasing. previously, these viruses were prevalent mainly in africa; however, their emergence suggests that more complex transmission networks may be present. due to the surge in mpox cases, the director general of the who declared the current outbreak a pheic on 14 august 2024. this series of events highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and research of different clades and their transmission patterns on a global scale. understanding the epidemiological characteristics, transmission routes, and effective response strategies of these viral clades is crucial.
figure 1.mpox: journey from viral isolation to global outbreak. from 1796, when edward jenner developed the smallpox vaccine using cowpox, to 2024, with 97,000 confirmed cases of mpox globally, the discovery, research, and control of mpox have evolved from vaccine foundations to global attention and breakthroughs in antiviral treatments..
figure 2.global distribution of mpox cases. since january 1, 2024, the total number of laboratory-confirmed mpox cases, which may include cases only confirmed as orthopoxvirus, is 21,430. among these, 5,813 cases are in locations with only clade ii mpox 11,911 cases are in locations with only clade i mpox virus, and 3,702 cases are in locations with both clade i and clade ii mpox. data presented as of october 6, 2024, were obtained from the cdc. materials and methods to understand the epidemiological characteristics, transmission routes, and effective prevention and control strategies for mpox, we searched multiple databases and resources through literature retrieval. we mainly used academic databases, such as pubmed, web of science, and google scholar, as well as the official documents and reports of the who, centers for disease control and prevention, and health departments of various countries. these resources provide the latest research results on mpox and relevant public health information. the key words included “mpox,” “monkeypox,” and their combinations, such as “mpox and outbreak” and “mpox surveillance and epidemiology.” to ensure coverage of key literature in this field. in order to ensure the relevance of the search results, we set clear inclusion and exclusion criteria: the included literature should clearly involve all aspects of mpox, such as epidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations, prevention and treatment measures, and be limited to the time range from 2020 to now. the language is english or other major languages. all the included literatures were double independently screened to ensure the objectivity and consistency of the literature screening process. through these steps, we aimed to systematically sort and analyse the retrieved data and provide a solid basis for the review. physiological and pathological characteristics of mpox mpxv is an enveloped, double-stranded dna virus. the viral particles were oval or brick shaped, with diameters of approximately 200–250 nm. the mpxv genome mainly includes a central conserved region and reverse terminal repeats, and virus-host interaction genes are located in the terminal region. mpxv replication is a complex and precise process that involves interactions between the virus and host cells at multiple stages. mpxv has two main forms: the intracellular mature virus and extracellular envelope virus. the virus enters the host cells through attachment and fusion, and the viral genome is released into the cytoplasm for transcription and replication. during replication, the imv and eev are formed. the imv are assembled in the cytoplasm and released outside the cell by lysis, and part of the imv can be further transformed into the eev. the eev mediates long-distance transmission in hosts by interacting with actin. the imv is responsible for the transmission of infections between hosts. this complex replication process allows mpxv to spread effectively in the host and between cells.
figure 3.replication cycle of mpox virus. this figure illustrates the life cycle of the mpox within a human cell. the replication cycle of the mpox virus transpires in the cytoplasm of the host cell. subsequent to viral attachment, the virion adheres to and merges with the host cell membrane, resulting in the release of the viral core into the host cell’s cytoplasm. viral particles are formed into intracellular mature viruses, which remain in the cytoplasm as intracellular mature virions or are discharged as extracellular enveloped viruses upon cell lysis. mv can encapsulate an extra envelope and adhere to the cell membrane, subsequently releasing through exocytosis.. the clinical manifestations of mpxv infection are similar to those of smallpox virus infection, which usually include prodromal symptoms such as fever, headache, myalgia, fatigue, sore throat, and subsequent rash. the primary distinction between mpox and smallpox is the presence of lymphadenopathy. approximately 10% of the patients with mpox have superficial lymphadenopathy, whereas patients with smallpox do not. the rash characteristics of mpox are essential for its identification. notably, mpox rashes have a centrifugal distribution, whereas chickenpox rashes are centripetal. mpox is a self-limiting disease. the incubation period is usually 5–21 d, and the disease course lasts for 2–5 weeks. deaths primarily occurred in children, pregnant women, and immunodeficient individuals. mpxv infection may involve the oral mucosa, digestive tract, genitalia, conjunctiva, cornea, and other organs. currently, mpox diagnosis usually depends on clinical symptoms and pcr detection of viral dna. there is no specific treatment for this disease, and most treatments are mainly symptomatic or conservative. preventive measures include avoiding contact with infected animals, eating thoroughly cooked meat, avoiding close contact with patients with mpox, and vaccination against smallpox.
figure 4.pathophysiology and symptoms of mpox. general features such as lymphadenopathy, fever, headache, sweats, sore throat, muscle ache, lack of energy, rash, and genital rashes are seen commonly. complications of mpox include pneumonitis, encephalitis, keratitis, and secondary bacterial infections.. the transmission routes of mpxv are complex and primarily involve animal- and human-to-human modes of transport. animal-to-human transmission routes include contact with infected animal blood, bodily fluids, skin, mucous membranes, scratches, bites from infected animals, or even consumption of infected animal meat. human-to-human transmission primarily occurs through contact with bodily fluids, blood, respiratory droplets, or even through sexual contact with infected individuals. recent studies have revealed that mpxv exhibits a high rate of genetic variation, which may result in unstable epidemiological characteristics, including speed of transmission and pathogenicity of the virus. studies have indicated that viral strains in recent mpox outbreaks differ from typical african strains by approximately 50 nucleotide sites, reflecting significant changes in the viral genome. this variation could lead to various manifestations of mpxv during human-to-human transmission, further complicating the epidemiological profile. therefore, there is an urgent need to accelerate the development of vaccines and medications to effectively control the mpox zepidemic. vaccines can confer immunity, thereby reducing the infection rate and disease severity. in contrast, medications treat individuals who are already infected, reduce complications, and prevent worsening of the disease. the spread of mpox can be effectively curtailed by intensifying the research and development of vaccines and medications.
figure 5.modes of mpox transmission. mpox can be transmitted through various means, including contact with animals infected with the mpox virus, direct contact with the body fluids or lesions of infected animals, animal bites or scratches, eating meat from infected animals, sexual contact, and contact with contaminated objects, respiratory secretions of infected individuals, as well as their bedding and clothing.. prevention and treatment of mpox mpxv belongs to the orthopoxvirus genus, and its differential diagnosis is complex and important because its clinical manifestations are similar to those of other members of the poxvirus family. pcr is considered the primary diagnostic tool for detecting viral dna. samples scraped from rashes, scabs, or blisters are considered the best specimens and require sterile refrigeration to maintain their stability. additionally, immunohistochemistry, viral culture, and electron microscopy can assist in confirming the presence of the virus. recent studies have shown that individuals are generally susceptible to mpxv and that vaccination with a smallpox vaccine provides a certain degree of cross-protection against mpxv. mpox can be prevented by smallpox or cowpox vaccination. however, currently no specific vaccine exists for the prevention of mpox infections. researchers have only improved the vaccine through gene recombination based on existing vaccines such as smallpox, which has improved its effectiveness and reduced toxicity and side effects. additionally, antiviral drugs have been developed to treat patients with viral infections. preventive effect of vaccines vaccines are vital tools to prevent disease infection, and can effectively control transmission before a disease outbreak and intervene in the development of the disease after disease exposure to reduce its severity. mpxv immunomodulatory proteins can be categorized by function into three separate groups: virostealth, virotransduction, and biomimicry. the virostealth proteins function intracellularly, diminishing the detection of mpx infection signals by disrupting host signalling pathways, hence impairing the ability of cell-mediated immune responses to identify and eliminate virus-infected cells. the virotransducer proteins function intracellularly to suppress innate antiviral signalling pathways and apoptotic responses to mpx infection. viromimetics represent the sole category of mpxv proteins with external functions. viroreceptors are cell surface glycoproteins that imitate host immune-related cytokine and chemokine receptors, binding to them and disrupting their functions, whereas virokines emulate host cytokines and chemokines, hence inhibiting their effects. mpxv immunomodulatory proteins function synergistically to circumvent the host’s antiviral innate immune response via several mechanisms, facilitating viral replication. mpxv and smallpox viruses belong to the genus orthopoxvirus and have significant similarities in genome structure and immune responses. studies have shown that the approved smallpox vaccines also provide cross-protection against mpox. dendritic cells can capture foreign antigens presented by different types of vaccines through phagocytosis, process them in the endoplasmic reticulum, and express their fragments on the cell surface through the major histocompatibility complex. cells directly recognize antigens and initiate humoral immune responses through b-cell receptors. simultaneously, they present antigen peptide fragments to helper t cells via mhc- ii molecules. antigen-presenting cells activate cd4+t cells and promote their differentiation into different subtypes, such as t follicular helper cells, which help b cells differentiate into memory b cells and plasma cells that secrete antibodies, thus promoting the generation of high-affinity antibodies. in addition, cytotoxic t cells recognize antigen peptide fragments presented by mhc-i molecules through the t-cell receptor and trigger a cellular immune response to kill and remove the virus-infected cells. the specific mechanism is illustrated in figure 6. however, since the global suspension of the smallpox vaccination in 1980, the number of individuals without cross-protection has increased, making it a potentially significant threat to human health. therefore, developing an mpox vaccine can prevent another large-scale outbreak of mpox and provide sufficient technical resources for subsequent research on other positive pox vaccines. currently, three smallpox vaccines have been approved for mpox treatment: acam2000, jynneos, and lc16m8. these vaccines were initially developed to prevent smallpox; however, they are also effective against mpox. however, these vaccines have different degrees of side effects, which must be considered.
figure 6.mpxv virus escape mechanism and vaccine-induced immune response. in viral mimicry, mpxv mimicry inhibits ifn, il-1β, and tnf, as well as host receptors bound by mpxv-encoded chemokines and growth factors. during viral transduction, intracellular mpxv-encoded proteins inhibit its function by interfering with antiviral pathways such as ifn, nf-κb, irf 3, and apoptosis. viral stealth is achieved with f1, an antiapoptotic host-range protein that contributes to viral replication and the spread of mpx infection. approved smallpox vaccines also provide cross-protection against mpox. after further vaccination, the foreign antigens presented by different types of vaccines are captured by dendritic cells through phagocytosis, processed in the endoplasmic reticulum, and processed by the major histocompatibility complex. mhc-i or mhc-ii) express their fragments on the cell surface. the cells directly recognize the antigen and initiate a humoral immune response through b-cell receptors. at the same time, they present antigen peptide fragments to helper t cells through mhc-ii molecules. antigen-presenting cells activate cd4+t cells and promote their differentiation into different subtypes, such as follicular helper t cells, which help b cells differentiate into memory b cells and antigen-secreting plasma cells, thereby promoting the production of high-affinity antibodies. in addition, cytotoxic t cells recognize antigenic peptide fragments presented by mhc-i molecules through t-cell receptors and trigger cellular immune responses to kill and eliminate virus-infected cells.. acam2000 acam2000 is a second-generation smallpox vaccine based on vaccinia virus replication. emergency product development produces it in the united states and is mainly used to prevent smallpox viral infections. this vaccine was approved by the food and drug administration in 2007 and is regarded as an essential strategic tool for dealing with smallpox virus outbreaks. acam2000 significantly prevents smallpox infection and exerts a protective effect against mpxv in animal models. studies have found that crab-eating macaques inoculated with acam2000 survive attacks by atomized mpxv. although signs of viral infection were observed, the animals were healthy. humoral and cell-mediated immune responses were initiated and high concentrations of neutralizing and igg antibodies were detected after vaccination. in addition, in a prairie groundhog model evaluating the effect of acam2000 after exposure, acam2000 showed significant effectiveness when applied on the first and third days after exposure. however, the use of acam2000 is accompanied by high-risk side effects, including skin reactions, eye complications, severe heart inflammation, and encephalitis, especially in individuals with a poor immune system or other health problems. therefore, although acam2000 is effective and provides an emergency response in dealing with smallpox virus infections, its use needs to be carefully weighed and evaluated in terms of the potential risk of severe side effects and the need for disease prevention. jynneos jynneos is a non-replicative vaccine made from modified live ankara vaccinia virus. the danish bavarian nordic company prepared this vaccine after more than 570 passages for viral reduction and six rounds of plaque purification. its safety and immunogenicity have been dramatically improved with the aim of treating mpxv infections and preventing smallpox. this vaccine has been approved in the united states and europe. unlike acam2000 and jynneos, these vaccinators do not produce live viruses; therefore, they are safer for use in individuals with poor immune function. however, individuals with poor immune function may have weak protection against jynneos vaccination than healthy people because of their compromised/reduced immune system. in a clinical trial, jynneos reached a peak in immune protection 14 d after the second subcutaneous injection, with a vaccination interval of 28 d. mpxv-neutralizing antibodies were detected in vivo after inoculation with the jynneos vaccine. however, some vaccinators may experience mild adverse reactions, such as tachycardia, palpitations, redness, swelling, pain, and itching at the injection site, which may occasionally be accompanied by fever. severe allergic reactions are relatively rare. although jynneos appears to be a safer choice for the current mpox epidemic, it efficacy and durability remain unknown. according to previous studies, the vaccine efficacy rate was approximately 85%, which requires further research and monitoring. therefore, when using the jynneos vaccine, especially in individuals with cardiovascular disease or other potential risks, close monitoring and evaluation are required to ensure a balance between safety and effectiveness. lc16m8 lc16m8 is a minimum replication-attenuated live vaccine that was developed in japan in the 1970s. the vaccine was officially licenced by japanese regulatory authorities in 1980 and is currently being produced by kaketsuken. the active ingredient of lc16m8 was derived from the lister/elstree strain of cowpox virus. this is mainly caused by a frameshift mutation in the extracellular envelope viral particle antigen b5r, which leads to the expression of a truncated protein, thereby weakening the virulence and replication abilities of the strain. previous animal models have shown that pre-exposure to the lc16m8 vaccine can prevent symptomatic mpxv infection, with a protective effect lasting up to 12 months. for animals with immune dysfunction/deficiency, lc16m8 does not cause severe vaccine-related adverse events, such as progressive cowpox, making it safer than the dryvax/list vaccine. post-exposure vaccination can improve clinical manifestations. human clinical trials have shown that the serum positivity rate for mpxv 30 d after lc16m8 vaccination was 100%. although the neutralizing titre was lower than that of the dryvax vaccine, it induced a strong cellular immune response with a higher trend of lymphocyte proliferation than dryvax and no serious adverse events occurred. large-scale vaccinations in the 1970s did not result in serious adverse events. however, some vaccinated individuals may experience mild-to-moderate adverse events such as pain and redness at the injection site. there may be limitations or increased risks for individuals with poor immune function and some patients with atopic dermatitis. however, the production and storage of lc16m8 require highly specialized facilities and technology, which may limit its promotion and application in resource-scarce areas. therefore, when choosing a vaccine, comprehensively considering the health status and medical history of an individual is necessary to ensure their safety and health. genetically engineered vaccines many studies have focused on developing genetically engineered vaccines. one vaccine, which combines the vacv lir and a33r genes, showed significant protection in mice. in further studies, the protective effects of vaccines containing the a27l and b5r genes were explored in mice. the results showed that the effects of these vaccines were consistent with previous research results. subsequently, these four genes were combined and a combination vaccine was administered to rhesus monkeys. research has shown that this four-gene combination vaccine can trigger an antibody response to the homologous protein of mpxv, demonstrating the potential of multigene vaccines to prevent mpox. hooper et al. developed a dna vaccine targeting four known vaccinia virus genes and administered it to rhesus monkeys before exposure to mpox. they found that, although single-gene vaccines can help monkeys survive, they cannot effectively protect them from mpox, possibly because of insufficient antibody production to neutralize the virus. however, when these four genes were included in the vaccine, their protective effect was significantly improved, and the virus was not detected in the oral secretions of the monkeys. these results support the critical role of multicomponent vaccine-antigen mixtures in the prevention and treatment of infection with smallpox viruses. simultaneously, hirao et al. conducted relevant research and established experimental groups of eight dna-encoded antigens, including a4l, a27l, a33r, a56r, b5r, f9l, h3l, and l1r. they found that five of these antigens produced high-level antibody reactions in macaques, which is consistent with the results of hooper et al.. furthermore, vaccines against mpox are under active development, such as mrna vaccines targeting mpxv developed by biontech, moderna, and wuhan institute of virology; these vaccines are in the early stages of development and have shown great potential for controlling future mpox transmission. in summary, these studies provide new directions for the development of effective mpox vaccines. therapeutic effect of antiviral drugs for patients with mpxv infection, the cdc recommends the use of tecovirimat, cidofovir, brinciclovir, and varicella immunoglobulin intravenous injection. because tecovirimat, cidofovir, and brinciclovir are genetically similar to members of the orthopoxvirus family, they show potential effectiveness against orthopoxviruses. recent studies have found that vigiv can be used to treat serious complications caused by vaccinia vaccines, such as generalized vaccinia and vaccinia eczema, and is suitable for patients with mpox infections who have poor immune function. although clinical data supporting human mpox infections is lacking, given the restrictions on vaccination and contraindications of some patients, these drugs have become a critical choice in emergency treatment, especially when disease symptoms cannot be effectively alleviated after mpox vaccination. tekverimat tecovirimat is an oral antiviral drug that has been developed by siga technologies and approved by the fda for smallpox treatment. the european drug administration has approved its use for the treatment of infections caused by other orthopoxviruses. it can effectively block further transmission of the virus in the host by inhibiting the function of the envelope protein, vp37, of the orthopoxviruses and preventing the release of viral particles. this drug is administered orally or intravenously. for adults and children weighing at least 3 kg, the oral dose is 6 mg administered twice daily for 14 consecutive days. the intravenous injection dose is adjusted according to the body weight of adult patients. the therapeutic efficacies of the smallpox vaccine acam2000 and tecovirimat administered alone or in combination, starting on day 3 post-infection, were compared in a cynomolgus macaque model of lethal mpox viral infection. post-exposure administration of acam2000 alone did not protect against severe mpox disease or mortality. in contrast, post-exposure treatment with tecovirimat, alone or in combination with acam2000, provided full protection. however, its shortcomings and limitations cannot be ignored, such as insufficient treatment data for human mpox infection and possible side effects, such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal discomfort, as well as reactions at the injection site. in addition, although it has been approved for clinical use, its practical application is limited due to cost and accessibility. cidofovir cidofovir is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug with an active form of a 5’- diphosphate metabolite that mainly acts by inhibiting dna polymerase replication. thus, cidofovir is effective against hiv, cowpox, mpox, and smallpox infections. in terms of usage, this drug is mainly administered through local and intravenous injections, with a recommended dose of 5 mg/kg for intravenous injection. common side effects include congenital disability, neutropenia, nausea, and muscle pain. studies have shown that cidofovir can effectively reduce lesion formation and mortality in experimental animal models, especially when used as a second-line treatment for severe cowpox. in addition, cidofovir can limit the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in experimental animals, thereby further controlling the severity of viral infection. however, cidofovir may cause nephrotoxicity when administered intravenously; therefore, renal function must be closely monitored and appropriate dose adjustments must be made to reduce the risk of this side effect. cidofovir has shown significant potential for treating viral infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals or cases of severe infections. however, its side effects and insufficient clinical data limit its application. further research and clinical validation are needed to improve its role in the treatment of mpox and other diseases. brinciclovir brincidofovir, also known as cmx001, inhibits mpxv replication by phosphorylating its active metabolite, cidofovir diphosphate. it is a lipid conjugate of cidofovir and functions as a diphosphate prodrug that explicitly targets dna viruses by selectively inhibiting viral dna polymerase activity. brincidofovir is available for oral consumption in the form of 100 mg tablets or a 10 mg/ml oral suspension, and is typically administered once every alternate week. recent studies have shown that some patients experience adverse reactions due to elevated liver enzymes after treatment with weekly oral doses of 200 mg brincidofovir, leading to non-completion of the entire treatment course. furthermore, gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhoea, vomiting, and abdominal pain have been linked to its use. brincidofovir has demonstrated significant therapeutic potential in various animal models of mpxv, suggesting that it may be an effective treatment for mpxv infections. additionally, parker et al. showed that a combined treatment of first- and second-generation vaccines and brincidofovir reduced the severity of vaccine-related lesions. in the case of post-exposure prevention, the combined administration of brincidofovir and vaccination should be considered as the first reaction of individuals with uncertain exposure status to a smallpox emergency or as a means to reduce the incidence and severity of vaccine-related adverse events. despite its promising performance in animal models, clinical implementation presents several challenges and constraints. for instance, the elevation of liver enzymes and other gastrointestinal adverse reactions in clinical trials necessitate close monitoring and management. additionally, owing to safety concerns related to drug accumulation, brincidofovir is contraindicated in immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, and neonates. vigiv vigiv is a hyperimmunoglobulin used to treat the complications of vaccination against cowpox. it originates from plasma and contains high titres of cowpox virus-specific igg antibodies, which are used to neutralize viral particles, thereby reducing viraemia and mortality. studies have shown that vigiv can significantly reduce viraemia and mortality rates by 30%–40%. vigiv is usually used to treat serious complications that may occur after vaccination against cowpox, such as progressive cowpox, systemic cowpox, cowpox dermatitis, and eye infections induced by the cowpox virus. in addition, prophylactic treatment with vigiv can be considered if immunodeficient individuals with severely impaired t-cell function have a history of exposure to the cowpox virus. furthermore, vigiv has shown successful application in some cases, significantly reducing the severity and mortality rate of eye infections caused by the cowpox virus. however, this drug has some drawbacks such as potential effects on blood sugar and insulin levels, and caution should be exercised in patients with renal insufficiency. in addition, although vigiv has been approved for cowpox treatment, its widespread use against other smallpox viral infections, such as mpox, lacks sufficient clinical data. further research is needed to verify its effectiveness and safety in these viral infections. conclusions with continuous changes in the environment and human activities, individuals have significantly increased opportunities to come in contact with potential sources of infection, leading to a rapid increase in the incidence of mpoxes. with the extension and increase in the mpox transmission chain, genetic variation of the mpxv continues, which may further enhance its transmissibility, toxicity, and pathogenicity. therefore, vigilance should be maintained when mpox continues to recur worldwide. outbreaks of potential diseases are often caused by neglecting the disease in its early stages, and every outbreak of a significant disease has an indelible impact on various parts of the world, posing a significant threat to human health. many questions remain regarding human diseases, animal hosts, viruses, and their environments, and more effective prevention and control methods are required. currently, few approved vaccines are available against mpox, and the specific mechanisms of action of effective antiviral drugs require further investigation. therefore, there is an urgent need to accelerate the development of novel vaccines and antiviral agents. in addition, implementing more robust preventive measures and reliable diagnostic tools to identify mpox and control the further spread of the virus is necessary.
the global monkeypox outbreak: a comprehensive review abstract monkeypox is a contagious illness that is caused by the monkeypox virus, which is part of the same family of viruses as variola, vaccinia, and cowpox. it was first detected in the democratic republic of the congo in 1970 and has since caused sporadic cases and outbreaks in a few countries in west and central africa. in july 2022, the world health organization declared a public-health emergency of international concern due to the unprecedented global spread of the disease. despite breakthroughs in medical treatments, vaccines, and diagnostics, diseases like monkeypox still cause death and suffering around the world and have a heavy economic impact. the 85,189 reported cases of mpox as of 29 january 2023 have raised alarm bells. vaccines for the vaccinia virus can protect against monkeypox, but these immunizations were stopped after smallpox was eradicated. there are, however, treatments available once the illness has taken hold. during the 2022 outbreak, most cases occurred among men who had sex with men, and there was a range of 7–10 days between exposure and the onset of symptoms. three vaccines are currently used against the monkeypox virus. two of these vaccines were initially developed for smallpox, and the third is specifically designed for biological-terrorism protection. the first vaccine is an attenuated, nonreplicating smallpox vaccine that can also be used for immunocompromised individuals, marketed under different names in different regions. the second vaccine, acam2000, is a recombinant second-generation vaccine initially developed for smallpox. it is recommended for use in preventing monkeypox infection but is not recommended for individuals with certain health conditions or during pregnancy. the third vaccine, lc16m8, is a licensed attenuated smallpox vaccine designed to lack the b5r envelope-protein gene to reduce neurotoxicity. it generates neutralizing antibodies to multiple poxviruses and broad t-cell responses. the immune response takes 14 days after the second dose of the first two vaccines and 4 weeks after the acam2000 dose for maximal immunity development. the efficacy of these vaccines in the current outbreak of monkeypox is uncertain. adverse events have been reported, and a next generation of safer and specific vaccines is needed. although some experts claim that developing vaccines with a large spectrum of specificity can be advantageous, epitope-focused immunogens are often more effective in enhancing neutralization. 1. introduction in recent years, there has been cause for concern due to a rapid and unprecedented pandemic of mpox infections in several countries all over the world. rodents and primates are the hosts for mpox, a zoonosis with symptoms like smallpox but less severe. when the virus was initially identified in monkeys in a danish laboratory in 1958, the term “monkeypox” was coined. the etiological agent of monkeypox, a zoonotic illness that can be transmitted to humans, is the monkeypox virus, which is a member of the orthopoxvirus genus that was originally mainly present in central and west africa. there have been numerous reports of human mpox from various countries that are not typically affected since may 2022. with the large number of proven cases and stories of the virus passing between people and within a population, it has become a cause for concern all over the world. the large number of people confirmed to have mpox around the world currently stands at over 85,189, and it is rapidly increasing in more than 110 nations. the who declared it a public health emergency of international concern on 23 july 2022 in order to alert the world of the danger it poses. since smallpox was eradicated in 1980, the mpox virus has been found to be the most prevalent orthopoxvirus impacting people. it produces a sickness that is identical to smallpox in humans. the signs and symptoms of the present mpox epidemic differ from those in the past, even though the virus was first identified many years ago. traditionally, the only genital sores associated with human mpox were ones that were all the same in appearance—pustular eruptions. the present monkeypox outbreak, however, is differentiated by genital rashes. additionally, the vaginal rash typically comes before the widespread pustular rash in non-endemic regions outside of africa. an initial infection in the genital region can cause a localized rash and, in rare instances, a subsequent widespread illness. additionally, skin lesions and prodromal symptoms are not significantly linked, and systemic symptoms are only present in around 50% of patients. the clinical syndrome is characterized by lymphadenopathy, rash, and fever. pneumonitis, encephalitis, sight-threatening keratitis, and subsequent bacterial infections are some of the possible side effects of mpox. skin rashes can present themselves at varying times, so medical professionals and scientists should be cognizant of this new reality, which is distinct from what has been observed in the past. many studies have shown that the way a person’s immune system works is closely linked to how their disease starts and worsens when they have a virus infection. immune escape is a common thing in orthopoxvirus infections and plays a significant part in how they spread. immunological patterns may serve as potential markers of disease progression and treatment targets for mpox. the association between intense mpox disease and immunological response is becoming more apparent, prompting a crucial infrastructure for guiding future investigations into mpox treatment. additionally, mpox-virus-induced immunological alterations and their potential immunopathogenesis should be further examined. in this review, we focus on transmission routes, proposed pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical diagnostics, phylogenetic clades of the mpox virus and their evolutionary divergence, virology, vaccines, and treatment strategy for the mpox virus in an update. 2. transmission route associated with mpox the current research implies that monkeypox may spread in three different ways: from person to person, via direct contact with infected organisms, and from animals to people. it is well established that animals can pass the mpox virus on to humans. the majority of the animals that are known to be carriers of the virus are rodents, such as rats, squirrels, and dormice, as well as numerous kinds of primates. on the other hand, there is evidence of a human-to-human transmission that has occurred not just in africa but also outside the continent. direct contact with skin lesions of infected animals or people, respiratory exposure to droplets from infected humans, and consumption of contaminated bushmeat are all potential routes of transmission for the mpox virus. during the current outbreak of the illness, researchers have shown that it is more prevalent in men who engage in sexual activity with other men. most cases of mpox have been identified in men who have had sex with other men. the cdc reports that transmission can occur through contact with an infected person. furthermore, semen analysis for many patients has revealed the presence of monkeypox-virus dna, which is a novel finding. the virus may pass from one person to another by respiratory contact, direct contact with body fluids from an infected person, or during pregnancy from the mother to the fetus. given that the pathogenic mpox virus can be isolated from samples of semen, there are signs that transmission may happen during sexual intercourse. the mpox virus could be stored in the genital area if it stays in seminal fluids for a long time. whether the virus can spread via vaginal secretions is unknown. even with adequate personal protective equipment, the virus may spread through fomites or by indirect contact with lesion material, such as through contaminated bedding, most commonly through inhalation. sharing a bed or room or using the same utensils as an infected individual are risk factors for transmission. factors involving the introduction of the virus to the oral mucosa are linked to increased transmission risk. it is still unknown whether those who do not have monkeypox symptoms can transmit the virus. currently, further study is being conducted to better understand how this particular strain of the west african lineage spreads, although the general consensus is that it is not unique. as far as we know, it does not disperse in the air like covid-19. mpox, in contrast to covid-19, is not communicable until the infected individual develops symptoms. therefore, it is much simpler to keep sick people apart and stop the spread of the disease. the transmission routes are explained in figure 1. 3. proposed pathophysiology of mpox virus the mpox virus is categorized as a category of the genus orthopoxvirus under the family poxviridae. macropinocytosis, endocytosis, and fusion are the three mechanisms through which poxviruses enter the cells of their hosts. the dna that makes up the mpox-virus genome is linear and double-stranded. the life cycle of the mpox virus takes place in the cytoplasm despite the fact that it is a dna virus. replication of viral dna, transcription of viral genes, and assembly of viral particles all need the presence of certain proteins. the two primary forms of contagious virions generated by compromised cells are intracellular mature virus and extracellular enveloped virus. these infectious virions are likely to be the most prevalent forms of the virus. eevs are capable of moving quickly through an infected individual’s body to reach different areas, whereas imvs are what spread the virus from one cell to another. the mpox virus has been divided into two separate genetic groups, west african and congo basin, which is also called the central african group. the cb clade has been observed in areas ranging from cameroon’s central and southern areas to the drc, whereas the wa clade has been reported from cameroon’s western areas to sierra leone. it is commonly assumed that the wa clade is more likely to cause epidemics through spillover from animal hosts, whereas the cb clade is considered to be the most hazardous, as it is capable of sustained human-to-human transmission with intense secondary attack rates. moreover, the wa clade produces the mildest symptoms, whereas the cb clade is seen as the most dangerous. the mpox-virus genome sequence of the current strains found in europe fits the west african clade, according to recent sequencing data, indicating a milder version of the disease, although this has to be validated. additionally, the mpox virus has three additional entry points into its host: the oropharynx, the nasopharynx, and intradermally. at the location of the vaccination, the virus multiplies before spreading to nearby lymph nodes. the virus spreads to other bodily organs after an initial phase of viremia. the mpox virus resembles other recognized orthopoxviruses in terms of appearance. the mpox virus has an exterior membrane made of lipoproteins and is oblong or brick-shaped. the 2003 pandemic in the west african clade in the united states provides proof that the disease’s intensity may differ between clades. humans and other primates are frequently less severely affected by west african monkeypox infections than animals. despite this, there were no fatalities reported during the epidemic that occurred in the united states in 2003 despite the fact that numerous people were hospitalized. the congo mpox virus causes t-cell activation via the t-cell receptor. it is interesting to note, though, that when human cells are produced from people who have already contracted the monkeypox virus, the generation of inflammatory cytokines is suppressed. this shows that the mpox virus may create a modulator that inhibits the responses of the host t cells. the central african clade has a complement-inhibiting gene, whereas the west african clade does not. it is an immune-modulating factor that may boost the central african clade’s pathogenicity compared to that of the west african clade. apoptosis in the host may be precisely modulated, which suggests that the central african monkeypox clade preferentially downregulates host responses in comparison to the west african clade. three west african strains and one central african strain were compared. the results showed a nucleotide difference of 0.55–0.56% between the central african strains and the west african strains. two viral strains were discovered to have distinct clusters through genomic research. whereas the west african strain is anticipated to contain 171 unique genes, the central african strain has 173 distinct functional genes. the two strains differ in their virulence; thus, 56 virulence genes were looked at, and 53 of them were present in both strains. the orthologs of br-203, br-209, and cop-c3l are where the two strains diverge most noticeably from one another. cytosolic mpox-virus pathways for the viral life cycle are shown in figure 2. 4. epidemiology the mpox virus was first reported in 1958 in laboratory monkeys employed for research purposes at state serum institutes in copenhagen, denmark, as well as in africa. humans in sub-saharan africa have been infected with monkeypox through intimate contact with diseased animals, suggesting that the disease has been present for thousands of years. mpox was formally recognized as a different illness in 1970, when the smallpox-eradication campaign revealed a continuing occurrence of smallpox-like disorders in rural regions. imported human mpox-virus infections beyond the african continent have been infrequent in the last 50 years. mpox has gained attention as a disease of global public-health significance since the first outbreak in the united states in 2003, which was linked to an infected pet prairie dog. it was believed that native prairie dogs housed alongside rats from ghana introduced in western africa were the main source of the pandemic. this is because most infected individuals became ill after coming into contact with pet prairie dogs in the summer of 2003, a cluster of illnesses in the us midwest was attributed to mpox. the main cause of the epidemic was believed to be native prairie dogs that were kept with rats imported from ghana in western africa. this conclusion was reached as the vast majority of those who became infected fell ill after being in contact with pet prairie dogs. since 2003, many cases of mpox have been reported in a variety of countries, with nigeria experiencing the worst epidemic in 2017. in 2018, two individuals with secondary mpox illness were reported by the united kingdom after they visited nigeria. over the past five years, there have been multiple cases of human mpox identified in areas all over africa. mpox has also spread to other areas, such as singapore, israel, the united states, and the uk. on 7 may 2022, the uk health security agency announced a confirmed case of mpox in a person who had recently traveled to nigeria. by 29 january 2023, the world health organization had received 85,189 suspected and/or confirmed cases of mpox from 110 countries, with the majority of cases occurring in europe and the americas, resulting in 86 fatalities around the world. according to an epidemiological-modeling study, the ro value for mpox varies from 1.10 to 2.40 in countries with little exposure to orthopoxvirus species. ro is also known as the reproduction ratio, and it is used to determine the disease’s transmissibility. this score indicates that an mpox pandemic is poised to break out in the case of imported human or animal cases. as previously noted, the stated ro indicates that each infected person has the ability to infect one to two other people. because the virus is infectious, an infected individual must take special steps to isolate themselves and prevent contact with others. globally, the number of weekly reported new cases dropped by 2.3% in week 3 compared to week 2. the bulk of cases recorded in the last four weeks were from the americas region and the african region. the united states of america, brazil, spain, france, colombia, the united kingdom, peru, mexico, germany, and canada are the ten most afflicted nations worldwide listed in figure 3. these top affected nations account for 85.2% of all cases recorded worldwide. in the last seven days, 18 nations have reported an increase in the weekly number of cases, with costa rica reporting the largest rise. in the last 21 days, 74 nations have reported no new cases. according to the cdc, india has had a total of 22 cases and 1 death due to the mpox virus. mpox showed up out of the blue in several countries and regions, but there was no initial epidemiological link to areas where the mpox virus has always been common. this suggests that transmission has been going on for a long time without being noticed. therefore, the monkeypox epidemic needs to be looked at with an open mind and with care. the world health organization reports a moderate risk to the entire world. however, the risk is high in the americas region and moderate in the africa, eastern mediterranean, europe, and south-east asia regions, according to the who. in contrast, the risk is believed to be low in the western pacific region. 5. clinical symptoms and diagnosis of mpox virus mpox is a virus belonging to the orthopoxvirus genus and has a clinical presentation similar to smallpox. its incubation period in humans typically ranges from four to 14 days but can be as long as 21 days. the disease begins with a febrile prodrome, which is accompanied by headache, muscle aches, backache, exhaustion, sweats, and fatigue. one to three days after the onset of fever, a rash appears on the face, inside the mouth, and on the hands, feet, chest, genitals, anus, and eyes. this rash begins as a flat macula and then becomes a papule before forming a vesicle filled with clear liquid. this clear liquid then turns into a yellowish liquid and forms pustules. once the pustules, crusts, and lesions fall off, the patient is no longer considered infectious. however, scarring from the rash is a common outcome of an infection. more severe complications such as pulmonary distress, bronchopneumonia, ocular infections, corneal scarring, and even permanent damage, as well as lymphadenopathy, may also occur. it can be difficult for clinicians to differentiate mpox from other viral or nonviral diseases due to its nonspecific clinical presentations. therefore, laboratory diagnosis is imperative. in order to accurately diagnose mpox, health providers should collect an appropriate specimen and send it securely to a suitable laboratory. this is because verifying human mpox virus depends on the type of sample and the available laboratory tests. the symptoms of this disease are very hard to distinguish and difficult to manage in low-income countries, which is why it is a global issue, as these regions are seen as endemic with the disease. the confirming processes for examining specimens and determining mpox virus are genetic, phenotypic, and immunological methods. table 1 lists the types of monkeypox tests that can be implemented to identify human mpox virus, and these strategies are more effective when combined with medical and epidemiological data, such as the patient’s immunization history. 6. phylogenetic clades of mpox virus and their evolutionary divergence phylogenomic studies indicate that there are at least three distinct clades of the mpox virus—clade 1, associated with west africa; clade 2, connected to the congo basin; and a novel clade 3, proposed following the 2022 european outbreak. although the clinical appearance of smallpox and mpox viruses are similar, the three clades suggest a distinct evolutionary divergence. the mpox virus is capable of infecting its host through various pathways, including the oropharynx, nasopharynx, and intradermal routes. it multiplies at the site of vaccination before eventually spreading to the lymph nodes. once the initial viremia phase has passed, the virus proceeds to spread to other organs. the mpox virus has an outer membrane composed of lipoproteins and is similar in appearance to other orthopoxviruses, typically presenting as an oblong or brick-shaped structure. the mpox virus requires specific proteins to be present for it to replicate its dna, transcribe its genes, and assemble its viral particles. its genome consists of linear, double-stranded dna, but the virus undergoes its life cycle in the cytoplasm, indicating its classification as a dna virus. there are three different ways in which poxviruses can enter the cells of their hosts: macropinocytosis, endocytosis, and fusion. the poxviridae family includes viruses with double-stranded dna that can affect many creatures, such as birds, reptiles, insects, and mammals. it can be divided into two subsections: chordopoxvirinae and entomopoxvarinae. monkeypox is part of the poxviridae family, the chordopoxvirinae subfamily, and the orthopoxvirus genus. the poxvirus species variola, cowpox, monkeypox, vaccinia, camelpox, alaskapox, yaba monkey tumor virus, tanapox virus, orf virus, pseudocowpox virus, bovine papular stomatitis virus, buffalopox, and molluscum contagiosum have all been identified as causing illnesses in humans. variola and molluscum contagiosum require humans as their main host. the mpox virus has been able to endure for quite a while in wild animals because of its huge range of potential hosts, and has sporadically spread to humans through spillover events. the significant aspect of orthopoxviruses is that they demonstrate immunological cross-reactivity and cross-protection, meaning that being infected with any one of these viruses will provide some level of protection against any other member of the same genus. viruses with a genome of 200–500 kb and a brick-like shape can range in size from 140–450 nm and are known as orthopoxviruses. there are more than 200 gene codes in the orthopoxvirus genome, and though some of them are not necessary for virus replication in cell culture, they may play an important role in the host’s antiviral defenses. all poxviruses utilize intricate molecular pathways in order to complete their replication cycle in the cytoplasm of infected cells. substantial study has been conducted on the intracellular-replication cycle of the vaccinia virus, the vaccine developed from which helped eradicate smallpox worldwide. other poxviruses share some of its important components. two distinct types of the virus, the internal mature virion and the external wrapped virion, which possess different surface glycoproteins, could potentially initiate the infection cycle. it is thought that glycosaminoglycans, which are found on the surfaces of mammalian cells, are necessary for the virus to attach itself to the cell membrane, even though not all cellular receptors have been determined. it is believed that millions of people worldwide perished due to smallpox. smallpox is widely regarded as one of the most feared infectious diseases in human history. the consequences of the disease are a reminder of the destructive capacity of orthopoxviruses. despite the lack of clarity around the origins of smallpox, there is some evidence to suggest that the variola virus may have descended from an ancient rodent poxvirus. people have been aware for a long time of the danger of zoonotic orthopoxvirus diseases such as the mpox virus to both humans and other animals. due to the suspension of smallpox-immunization programs over 40 years ago, a large portion of the global population has no immunity to smallpox and zoonotic orthopoxviruses. this raises the possibility that a zoonotic orthopoxvirus like the mpox virus may gain the ability to spread more easily among humans if certain conditions are met, such as an increase in human infections and the continued absence of vaccination protection. researchers must focus on the virology of how pox viruses are altering normal cells and damaging organs. 7. vaccines for mpox virus in order to prevent the spread of the mpox virus and protect people from it, there are multiple steps that must be taken. vaccines are the most effective way to achieve this goal, yet unfortunately, there is currently no specific vaccine for the mpox virus. however, research has revealed that the same smallpox vaccine that was used to protect people against smallpox may be effective in protecting against the mpox virus as well. previous knowledge shows that receiving a smallpox vaccination could result in a reaction to the mpox virus and may be able to protect from being infected by the virus by up to 85%. the food and drug administration has approved acam2000, a second-generation smallpox vaccine, to be used to prevent exposure to smallpox during an outbreak or crisis. therefore, it has been acquired for the strategic national stockpile and is available to be used for a range of demographic groups. furthermore, jynneos was authorized to be used in the united states and canada in 2019 after a series of animal studies. clinical trials have also demonstrated its strong effectiveness and safety, which can be used to protect people in many different age groups from getting infected with the mpox virus. the approval was due to the effectiveness in animals, the safety profile in humans, and the evidence that jynneos had a similar immunogenicity to existing smallpox vaccinations. in addition, due to the verified protective effects in animal studies and the immunizing action seen in human trials, the us food and drug administration’s emergency investigational new drug program approved lc16 both in the us and in japan. no data exists on the efficacy of lc16 for avoiding mpox-virus infections, even though it is the only smallpox vaccine available for kids. it is essential to note that when taking pre-exposure precautions, these vaccinations can often stop mpox-virus infection. yet, experts have demonstrated that post-exposure immunization may be able to stop the onset of serious diseases or reduce the intensity of the issues experienced by those who have been infected with the mpox virus. in this scenario, it is recommended to get vaccinated promptly after being exposed. the centers for disease control and prevention has confirmed that vaccination within four days of exposure can prevent the onset of illness. if this window is missed, the disease may still occur, but immunization in the first two weeks can help to avoid more serious consequences. currently, three vaccines for orthopoxviruses are accessible: acam2000, jynneos, and lc16. the initial vaccine, acam2000, is a replicating vaccine; however, the other two vaccines are either non-replicating or minimally replicating. in 2015, the food and drug administration and the united states government gave acam2000 a permit to treat smallpox and monkeypox. from 2015 to 2019, it was the only monkeypox vaccine that could be purchased in the united states. cell-culture techniques were utilized in both france and the usa to create acam2000. those aged from 18 to 64 were allowed to use it. emergent biosolutions manufactured this second-generation, replication-capable, live-attenuated, plaque-purified vaccine. the scarification technique with a bifurcated needle is used to deliver the vaccine percutaneously by repeatedly injecting it into the surface of the skin. this single-dose vaccine grants maximum immunity 28 days after immunization. people exposed to highly virulent orthopoxviruses require booster doses every three years, whereas those exposed to low-virulent orthopoxviruses must be administered booster doses every 10 years. the mva-bn vaccine created by bavarian nordic is a third-generation, live-attenuated, nonreplicating ankara vaccine. it is a two-dose vaccination that must be taken 28 days apart in order to generate immunity. clinical trials indicated that a substantial antibody response was seen after the initial dosage. following the second dose, immunity was established. those exposed to highly virulent orthopoxviruses need to receive a booster shot every two years, whereas those exposed to low-virulence strains need one every 10 years. in 2019, this vaccine was given the green light by the fda for use in canada to prevent smallpox and monkeypox in adults aged 18 and older who are at high risk. km biologics created a third-generation vaccination called the lc16 vaccine, which was granted a license for use against smallpox in japan in 1975 and against monkeypox in the usa in 2014. this live-attenuated, minimally replicating vaccine was made using cell-culture techniques and has an immunogenic-membrane protein b5r that has been eliminated. a bifurcated needle is used to percutaneously administer the multidose vaccination, which is suitable for individuals of all ages, including newborns and toddlers. it is essential to look into the reactogenicity, safety, and any possible adverse effects of the vaccine in order to ensure the most effective selection, especially for those in high-risk and vulnerable groups. for example, there are various vaccines that can be used for healthy individuals, such as those that are nonreplicating, slightly replicating, and replicating. researchers need to make a vaccine specifically for the monkey-pox virus to increase protection against the virus. 8. treatment for mpox a total of 85,189 cases of mpox infection as of 29 january 2023 have alarmed the world. historically, immunization against the vaccinia virus could safeguard against mpox; however, since smallpox was eradicated, this type of vaccination has ceased. consequently, therapeutic options for those already infected are of considerable importance. no antiviral drugs that have been approved by the american food and drug administration are specifically created to target the mpox virus. however, other medications such as tecovirimat and brincidofovir, both of which are effective against smallpox, as well as cidofovir, an antiviral approved to fight cmv, have been shown to be effective against orthopoxviruses in laboratory experiments. in 2018, the us food and drug administration approved tecovirimat for the treatment of smallpox in adults and children. this medication works by preventing vp37, a viral-envelope-wrapping protein, from functioning properly and blocking viral replication and release. it is currently available in the us free of charge under an expanded-access investigational new drug protocol. tecovirimat can be taken orally or intravenously. although there is not enough evidence yet to show how effective it is for treating mpox, it has been reported to have mild side effects like headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and neutropenia in one trial participant. the use of an intravenous formulation may lead to redness, pain, and swelling at the area of infusion. in june 2021, the fda approved the use of brincidofovir against smallpox in both adults and children. this prodrug of cidofovir comprises a lipid conjugate and is converted to cidofovir diphosphate within the cells, which inhibits the viral dna polymerase, eventually stopping the replication of the virus. although there is a dearth of data on the use of brincidofovir against mpxv, animal studies have revealed that when treatment was administered at the appropriate time, infected prairie dogs had survival rates of between 29 and 57%. adler et al. reported three cases of human mpox that were addressed by administering brincidofovir. however, the treatment was discontinued due to a rise in the levels of liver enzymes. an advantage of brincidofovir over cidofovir is that it is available in both pill and liquid forms and is smoother on the kidneys. cidofovir and its prodrug, brincidofovir, have the same method of working. there is a lack of evidence from humans on the effectiveness of cidofovir against monkeypox, but there are animal studies that show that it is useful against orthopoxviruses such as cowpox, vaccinia, ectromelia, and rabbitpox. thornhill et al. mentioned cases from the 2022 mpox outbreak being treated with cidofovir, which is only obtainable as an intravenous formulation but can carry a risk of severe renal toxicity. in the treatment of the mpox virus there is no specific treatment available in the current outbreak, so researchers should work on a treatment strategy. in figure 4 below, the life cycle of mpox virus inside the host-cell cytoplasm is illustrated to elicit the mechanism of action of three different antiviral therapies: cidofovir, brincidofovir, and tecovirimat. 9. challenges currently, operational research faces challenges in understanding the dynamics of monkeypox transmission and control due to limited resources for detailed case investigations and contact follow-up in affected communities. a serious issue is the lack of adequate diagnostic facilities in laboratories. the difficulty in diagnosing the mpox virus arises from the insufficiency of laboratory-diagnosis capacity and access, making it challenging to identify any underlying etiology. to comprehend the epidemiology and subclinical infection among contacts in communities, a seroprevalence study is crucial. however, currently available serological assays are generic orthopox tests, and they cannot specifically identify the mpox virus due to cross-reactivity between the mpox and smallpox viruses. hence, it is challenging to distinguish between mpox-virus infection and prior smallpox vaccinations or other orthopoxvirus infections. moreover, these assays are not available on the marketplace. data collected from nigeria reveal that approximately 20% of 70 monkeypox-negative patients with a rash illness that had similar antigens also had orthopox antibodies. in addition, there is no specific antiviral treatment for mpox. treatment is primarily supportive, focusing on managing symptoms such as fever and rash. vaccination with the smallpox vaccine can provide some protection against mpox, but the vaccine is not widely available in many countries. further research, including molecular and genomic approaches, is necessary to identify other orthopoxviruses transmitted in human and animal populations. 10. conclusions and future prospective mpox is a viral disease that is closely related to smallpox and primarily found in remote parts of central and west africa. there is currently no specific vaccine for mpox, but the smallpox vaccine provides some protection against the disease. however, the smallpox vaccine is no longer routinely administered, and many younger people in africa may not have received it. several vaccines are being studied for their potential effectiveness against mpox, including live-attenuated mpox vaccines, dna vaccines, and recombinant vaccines. synthetic peptide-based prototype vaccines have also shown promise in preclinical studies, and researchers are investigating the use of mrna vaccines for booster purposes in those who have received the mrna vaccine for covid-19. overall, the development of effective vaccines for mpox is an ongoing area of research, and scientists are working to develop new vaccines that can protect against this rare but potentially serious disease.
progress and prospects on vaccine development against monkeypox infection abstract the monkeypox virus is an uncommon zoonotic illness brought on by an orthopoxvirus. mpox can occur with symptoms similar to smallpox. since april 25, 2023, 110 nations have reported 87,113 confirmed cases and 111 fatalities. moreover, the outspread prevalence of mpox in africa and a current outbreak of mpox in the u.s. have made it clear that naturally occurring zoonotic opxv infections remain a public health concern. existing vaccines, though they provide cross-protection to mpox, are not specific for the causative virus, and their effectiveness in the light of the current multi-country outbreak is still to be verified. furthermore, as a sequel of the eradication and cessation of smallpox vaccination for four decades, mpox found a possibility to re-emerge, but with distinct characteristics. the world health organization suggested that nations use affordable mpox vaccines within a framework of coordinated clinical effectiveness and safety evaluations. vaccines administered in the smallpox control program and conferred immunity against mpox. currently, vaccines approved by who for use against mpox are replicating, low replicating, and non-replicating. although vaccines are accessible, investigations have demonstrated that smallpox vaccination is approximately 85% efficient in inhibiting mpox. in addition, developing new vaccine methods against mpox can help prevent this infection. to recognize the most efficient vaccine, it is essential to assess effects, including reactogenicity, safety, cytotoxicity effect, and vaccine-associated side effects, especially for high-risk and vulnerable people. recently, several orthopoxvirus vaccines have been produced and are being evaluated. hence, this review aims to provide an overview of the efforts dedicated to several types of vaccine candidates with different strategies for mpox, including inactivated, live-attenuated, virus-like particles, recombinant protein, nucleic acid, and nanoparticle-based vaccines, which are being developed and launched. graphical abstract image 1 introduction the orthopoxviruses are a genus of the poxviridae's chordopoxvirus subfamily, including members that cause sickness in humans and other animals. the most well-known member of this genus, variola virus, is a human-specific pathogen that caused smallpox, which was eliminated more than three decades ago after widespread immunization with the closely related vaccinia virus. the monkeypox virus is prevalent in several african nations. however, rodents are likely the primary reservoir, with monkeys and humans serving as accidental hosts. human-to-human transmission of mpox is expected to occur predominantly via close contact with symptomatic patients. it is assumed to occur through direct or indirect interaction with living or dead infected animals. phylogenetic analysis revealed that viral diversity is geographically structured into two major clades. these were named for the places where the virus is most prevalent: west africa and the congo basin. there have been five significant mpox outbreaks documented, occurring in 1970, 1996–97, 2003, and 2018,,,, ]. a multi-country epidemic that is continuing in 2023, with 86,724 confirmed cases and 112 fatalities recorded from 110 countries. as of 24 july 2022, the highest number of cases was in the countries of the u.s., gibraltar, portugal, the netherlands, and malta. the u.s. has the highest number of infected patients, with 29,980 cases. however, the mpox generates relatively subtle symptoms in immunocompetent persons. if the virus spreads to those with weakened immune systems, children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with co-morbidities like hiv/aids and diabetes, severe sickness or death may follow. the precise cause of mpox's reappearance has yet to be determined. however, one of the likely drivers of the mpox worldwide expansion might be the 1980 discontinuation of smallpox vaccination, which resulted in a lack of waning of people's immunity. mpox infection was characterized by a distinctive rash of several hundred simultaneous lesions on the face, arms, legs, and, less often, the palms, soles, or genitalia. prodromal signs such as fever, lymphadenopathy, and influenza-like symptoms usually preceded the rash. however, preliminary research on the virus suggests that cases in the current outbreak are atypical, with the rash appearing in more unusual areas of the body, particularly the genital and perianal areas, without spreading to other body regions and with a relative mildness or absence of prodromal symptoms. the patient experiences a rash on the face that extends to other body parts after the onset of a fever. the oropharynx is where lesions originate and progress throughout the body. after exposure, serum abs might be found around two weeks later. depending on the genetic makeup of the mpox strain causing the infection and the accessibility to contemporary treatment, the mortality rate ranges between 1 and 10%. the severe skin problem raises worries about subsequent bacterial infections of the skin, which have been seen in 19% of unvaccinated mpox patients. as stated by the who, mpox is treated with supportive care. vaccines and remedial produced for smallpox and accepted in some countries can be utilized for mpox in some situations. mpox is recently being treated with medications formerly administered for smallpox or other infections arising from the orthopoxvirus, including tecovirimat, cidofovir, and brincidofovir. furthermore, vaccinia immune globulin, which is created from composed human plasma of individuals who have been administered the smallpox vaccination, is one of the treatments for mpox. international health administrators have proposed many methods to combat mpox transmission, including the introduction of vaccinations for those who have had close contact with mpox patients and for populations at risk of occupational exposure to mpox. close contact with lesions, bodily fluids, respiratory droplets, and fomite may transfer mpox from person to person. however, the current epidemiological environment raises questions regarding the viral transmission dynamics and epidemic scale. since the vaccine's intended effect is protection against mpox, it makes sense to create it directly from the virus. a pure, attenuated, or already dead virus is used in one of the more conventional methods. although the smallpox vaccine preserves immunity against mpox, it is doubtful to be of any use given the current incidence in the year 2022. this is shown by the fact that smallpox vaccination programs were abandoned 50 years ago and that there is now no vaccine available for nations with minimal resources. it is possible to use smallpox and mpox vaccinations as pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure preventive measures. to protect contacts and vulnerable individuals at high risk, prep injection is best delivered in conjunction with second or third-generation vaccinations, such as acam2000, lc16m18, and jynneos vaccines. within 4–14 days of exposure, pep injections can be given to treat the condition and lessen the severity of the infection,, ]. acam2000 and jynneos are two u.s. food and drug administration-confirmed vaccines that can inhibit mpox infection. however, acam2000 may cause significant adverse events, such as coronary artery disease, whereas jynneos is related to fewer side effects. the current worldwide prevalence has once again focused on the requirement for continuous monitoring and the advance of new prevention and curative methods. in 2019, a new vaccine based on a modified attenuated vaccinia virus was allowed for mpox inhibition. while the acam2000 vaccine led to some adverse events in atopic dermatitis individuals and immunocompromised individuals, the modified vaccinia ankara vaccine is safe to utilize in those sick individuals. smallpox vaccine is believed to be cross-protective against mpox, with some information from minor investigations appraising preservation as high as 85%. based on existing data, there is still a need to progress an efficient and safe novel generation of vaccines particular for mpox that are developed into novel vaccine methods, such as virus-like particles, recombinant protein, nucleic acid, and nanoparticle-based vaccines, before mpox is declared a pandemic. to create better-defined vaccines, subunit vaccines targeting preservative antigens and delivered as purified protein or plasmid dna or virally vectored vaccines targeting one or both of the two immunologically distinct infected types of poxviruses, the mature virion and the enveloped virion, have been developed. nucleic acid vaccines are safe and successfully mimic the immunization of inactivated vaccines. furthermore, the industrial generation of such vaccines is affordable and straightforward. to recognize the most efficient vaccine, it is essential to assess effects, including reactogenicity, safety, cytotoxicity effect, and vaccine-associated side effects, especially for high-risk and vulnerable people. the 2022 extra-african mpox epidemic has highlighted the absence of vaccines with proven effects and low reactogenicity. it is considered that the utilization of this vaccine in the mpox outbreak may play a function in the inhibition or attenuation of the infection as prep is in close contact with approved cases. in this review, we will summarize the various characteristics of mpox, such as structure, genome, and pathogenesis. in addition, we present an up-to-date discussion of the current state of knowledge regarding the mpox virus, with a particular focus on innate and adaptive immune response and vaccination against the mpox. the advantages and disadvantages of all the traditionally used mpox vaccines, including lc16m8, acam2000, jynneos, and dryvax, were reviewed. additionally, this review aims to give a general overview of the work done to develop and assess various novel vaccine candidates for mpox, including inactivated vlps, recombinant protein, nucleic acid, and nanoparticle-based vaccines. this review article may aid in the creation of an innovative and valuable mpox preventive strategy. characteristics and structure of the monkeypox virus despite having a sizable linear double-stranded dna that contains all the enzymes required for replication and assembly, mpox translates their genetic material in the cytoplasm of infected cells using the ribosomes of their host cells. approximately 200 by 250 nm-sized lipoprotein outer membrane surrounds the ovoid or brick-shaped mpox. intracellular mature virions and extracellular enveloped virions are the two types of virions. evs have a separate envelope that mvs do not. a dumbbell-shaped nucleus and two lateral bodies are positioned between the concavities and the outer membrane within the viral particle. scientists recently developed confident assumptions regarding the structure of mpox variations' whole proteome, as well as the pockets that contain tiny molecules. mpox has immunological cross-reactivity with three additional opxvs that infect humans, soluble antigens, nucleoprotein antigens, and erythrocyte agglutinins. each mpox contains more than 30 viral structural and membrane proteins, dna-dependent rna polymerase, and associated transcriptional enzymes. the viral core and lateral body, which include some proteins, were coated by a lipoprotein envelope on the surface of the mv. when a cell is destroyed, mv is released, and it is generally stable in the outside environment. it is used chiefly for transmission. a lipid membrane is wrapped around mvs to create ev, which is then released by exocytosis. it came from the movement of endosomes or the golgi apparatus.fig. 1the structural features of mpox and its structure of the extracellular enveloped and intracellular mature orthopox virion. mpox is an enveloped ds-dna virus that belongs to the genus opxvs in the family poxviridae.fig. 1 monkeypox genome the inverted terminal repeats of the mpox are made up of hairpin loops, tandem repeats, and a few open reading frames, and the mpox is a 197 kb linear ds-dna covalently joined at its ends by palindromic hairpins. variable ends with inverted terminal repeat protect the genomes favorably conserved central coding site. at least 90 orfs are required for poxvirus replication and morphogenesis. many extra non-essential orfs contribute to variances in poxvirus host tropism, immunomodulation, and pathogenicity, with many orfs currently awaiting functional characterization. the outer membrane protects membrane junctions and the densely packed core, which contains enzymes, a ds-dna genome, and transcription factors. all proteins required for viral dna replication, transcription, virion assembly, and egress are encoded by the mpox genome. according to a comparison of the varv and mpox genomes, the core region of the mpox genome contains essential enzymes and structural proteins and is 96.3% similar to that of the varv. however, the terminal portions of the mpox genome that encode virulence and host range factors vary dramatically. these areas of mpox and other opxvs contain multiple known host ranges and immunomodulatory genes. these genes have developed precisely to block many processes simultaneously, including pattern-recognition receptor signaling, apoptosis, chemokine and cytokine function, and lymphocyte and antibody activity. according to o'toole and rambaut, a cytidine deaminase termed apolipoprotein b editing complex may be driving the recent fast development of mpox. cytidine deaminases cause double-stranded breaks in dna at switch sites.fig. 2mpox genome structure. there are about 197 kilobase pairs in the mpox genome, with the core genomic region totaling 101,476 kbp. the coding area, nr1, and nr2 sections, and inverted terminal repeats totaling 6379 base pairs are present in both ends of the molecule.fig. 2 monkeypox virus pathogenesis during viral entry, fusion, replication, and release, known as pathogenesis, mpox generates two infectious forms, evs and mvs. evs are mvs that have been changed to have three membranes, each of which is antigenically distinct, as opposed to mvs, which are restricted by a single membrane and are only released following host cell lysis. it has been shown that ev antigen-targeting vaccines and abs provide less protection than those that do. enveloped virions are those that leave the host cell, while cell-associated enveloped virions are those that remain on the cell surface. there are differences between cevs and evs, but because of their resemblance, we shall use the word ev to designate both cev and ev. previously, mpox was produced, collected from cell culture, sonicated, frozen, and thawed to release mv. so, the inoculum's evs lose their protective outer membrane and are replaced by mv. mpox may enter the body intradermally, via the nasopharynx, or through the oropharynx. before spreading to local lymph nodes, the virus multiplies at the injection site. once the virus has established itself in the bloodstream, it travels to other body parts. mpox has morphological similarities with other recognized opxvs. mpoxs have an exterior membrane composed of lipoproteins and can be either oval or brick-shaped. the expression of early genes is required for both the start of viral dna synthesis and the production of transcriptional regulatory factors for intermediate genes. the middle transcription factor family is a subset of late transcription factors. virions can be produced and assembled in the cytoplasm's electron-rich regions where mature protein molecules and enzymes are present. this is important for several reasons, including the attraction of early transcription factors intended to be packed into developing virions. in developing virions, emerging genomic dna is organized into genome units and crammed into enormous concatemeric precursors. some imvs undergo a subsequent envelope whereby they acquire even more glycoproteins; this is facilitated by proteolytic activities that also encourage the formation of immature components in imvs. successful lysis of the host cell is necessary to release the most mature intracellular virions. after maturing within a cell, most viruses must develop extra membranes before escaping. they may exit as an enveloped virus that can infect other cells, or they may choose to stay on the cell surface. mature intracellular virions can also be released when the cell's outer membrane is ruptured, either by mechanical stress or components of the host's complement system. recent studies have shown that several cellular proteins, including vacuolar protein sorting 52, conserved oligomeric golgi 4, cog7, and vps54, are essential for the viral replication cycle. identifying these proteins as host targets may provide viable intervention strategies for mpox infection, even if it is unclear how their interactions together exacerbate mpox-induced host disease.fig. 3schematic representation of an mpox life cycle. enveloped virion enters the host cell by fusion and the mature virion by micropinocytosis or fusion.fig. 3 monkeypox infection immunopathology to spread, viruses must replicate inside host cells since they rely on the host and aim to disrupt cellular growth and immune control. mpox delays or blocks apoptosis, impairs antiviral host defense, and hijacks host cell machinery. although the virus was identified decades ago, the topic of human immunity to mpox infection has not been explored extensively. because of this, it is common practice to interact findings about mpox interactions with the host immune system from studies of vacv and related opxvs. monkeypox infection innate immune response the innate immune response to viruses serves as the body's initial line of defense against infection and is necessary for developing adaptive immunity. in the first step of the innate immune response, dna sensors such as cyclic gmp-amp synthase, dna-dependent protein kinase, and interferon-inducible protein 16 recognize the viral dna genome. next, adaptor proteins like stimulator of interferon genes are activated, initiating innate immune signal transduction and leading to the production of a wide range of host defense molecules like ifn and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. infection with the poxvirus triggers a cytosolic dna sensor, which then activates an adaptor, which triggers a cascade of downstream effectors to create interferons, cytokines, and interleukins. many genes related to immunity, such as those that regulate leukocyte chemotaxis and immune cell activation, were altered by the cowpox virus and mpox. most of these genes exhibited considerable upregulation after infection with cpxv and mpox, which may suggest that the hosts' antiviral response is not sufficiently subverted. this is supported by the finding that immune-related genes, including il6, were upregulated in response to modified vacv ankara infection of hela cells that had been attenuated but not in response to non-attenuated vacv wr infection. other studies have also connected increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to cpxv and mpox infection. alkhalil et al. discovered increased il-8 gene expression after mpox infection of mk2 cells. after mpox or cpxv infection, significant secretion of il-6, il-8, and g-csf or il-6, il-8, and ccl-2 was observed in vivo in cynomolgus macaques. data from transcriptomic analysis of an in vitro infection model showed that mpox might inhibit the expression of the mapk-erk pathway and other components of the innate immune signaling system. the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 was also observed to be attenuated in an infected rhesus monkey tissue segment. however, mpox may cause many cytokine productions in critically ill individuals, including granulocyte-mabs yet colony-stimulating factor, il-10, and il-2 receptors.fig. 4this diagram shows how mpox infection may have an immunopathogenesis. the nk cell's ability to destroy virus-infected cells and release pro-inflammatory cytokines may be inhibited by mpox. by preventing t cell receptor trans-signaling, mpox may also obstruct the adaptive immune response.fig. 4 to control mpox, natural killer cells are crucial. study results in infected rhesus macaques show that the mpox infection significantly increases the number of all nk cell subsets in the blood and lymph nodes. the resistance loci remain unknown, although most wild strains of lab mice are unsusceptible to opxvs. wild mice may be very susceptible to mpox. the cast/eij mouse strain is one of the few laboratory mouse strains especially vulnerable to opxvs because of low nk cell numbers and insufficient ifn response. these mice are protected from fatal mpox infection by receiving either ifn- γ or il-15, which promotes nk cell proliferation,,, ]. the studies showed that mpox affects nk-cell activities and suppresses ifn-α and tnf-secretion as well as c-c motif chemokine ligand 5, c-x-c motif chemokine receptor 3, and c-c motif chemokine receptor 6 expression. changes in immunological mediators brought on by mpox infection are associated with sickness severity. regulating the complement system is one more method used by mpox to evade the immune system. the d14l gene encodes the mpox inhibitor of complement enzyme in the central african mpox strain but not in the west african strain; mopice hinders the formation of a c3 convertase complex.fig. 5this illustration shows how mpox infection may have an immunopathogenesis. the nk cell's ability to destroy virus-infected cells and release pro-inflammatory cytokines may be inhibited by mpox. by preventing t cell receptor trans-signaling, mpox may also obstruct the adaptive immune response.fig. 5 humoral immunity to monkeypox recent studies have emphasized the significance of cellular and humoral immunity in the defense against poxviruses. the vital importance that vaccine-induced anti-body reactions play in protecting against re-exposure to poxviruses is a critical finding from this study. iga, igm, and total abs can be found using serological ab assays specific to certain mpox antigens. these primates generated 23 different opxv proteins identified by the anti-mpox igg. vaccination results in a more limited serologic response to mpox than natural infection since the abs detected in smallpox vaccine recipients were specific to just 14 opxv proteins. in the wake of the 2003 smallpox pandemic in the united states, scientists analyzed the prevalence of mpox infections among patients who had and had not had a smallpox vaccination. within the first week of infection, both groups showed signs of igm and igg abs. the igm levels in the unprotected group spiked more dramatically during the first two weeks of illness and were detectable for 126 days compared to 77 days in the vaccinated group. although the unvaccinated group had a more extended period of igg positive, the vaccinated group had a more strong igg response within the first 56 days. monkeypox infection adaptive immune response t cells are essential for containing and getting rid of viral infections. the research also shows that wt mpox-z-infected animals produce a humoral and cellular immune response against the virus, as demonstrated by an increase in the number of memory b cells that are proliferating, the production of igg that is specific for mpox, the growth of ifn-γ/tnf-α—secreting t cells that are specific for opxv antigens, and the proliferation of memory t cells. beginning with the rise in viral loads found in infected animals, the adaptive immune response closely mirrored the management and healing of the mpox infection,, ]. t-cell-mediated cytokine responses after co-infection with varv and mpox were decreased by 95% when compared to responses after varv infection alone and by 80% when a low dose of mpox was administered. researchers demonstrated that mpox suppressed t cells that had been stimulated by varv and that mpox encodes the imm protein that varv lacks. an early gene product was discovered after infecting peripheral blood mononuclear cells with varv or mpox in the presence or absence of cytosine arabinoside, which inhibits the production of late genes. this was attributed to arac's ability to reduce the body's anti-cd3 responses. this suggests that an ancient gene was responsible for mpox's immunosuppression of t cells. hammarlund et al. postulated that mpox has similar immune evasion mechanisms to cpxv because mpox encodes a close homolog of cpxv203, which maintains a major histocompatibility complex class i in the endoplasmic reticulum. however, the mpox evasion mechanism prevented cd4+ and cd8+ t cell activation following cognate contacts with mpox-infected cells, protecting the viral reservoir from immune surveillance. even though mpox can infect primary human monocytes, antiviral cd4+ and cd8+ t cells were not able to identify infected monocytes. this demonstrated that virus-specific t lymphocytes were not stimulated to produce inflammatory cytokines in response to mpox. even though cd8+ t cells are well known to be essential for recovery from primary infection, recent research called into question their role in recovery from secondary poxvirus infections. b cell-deficient mice infected with ectromelia virus, a member of the same genus as the human smallpox pathogen varv, cannot recover from primary infection despite mounting a solid cd8+ t cell response, suggesting that abs are required for clearance of a poxvirus. in mice, protective ab responses to the poxvirus appear t cell-dependent and necessitate mhc-ii molecules, cd40, and b cells during a secondary infection,, ]. different types of vaccines for monkeypox infection it has been shown that smallpox vaccination provides 85% pre-immunization against mpox infection. approximately 50 years afterward the stop of immunization, with the enhancement in the number of individuals infected with mpox, re-emergence of this disease was detected. therefore, mpox was categorized as an emergent disease via the who and development blueprint in 2018. there have been hints since the 1960s that immunological responses unique to the vaccine may protect mpox. vaccination with dryvax or another first-generation smallpox vaccine offered complete protection against illness in almost all vaccinated animals in three experiments, including chimpanzees, rhesus macaques, and cynomolgus macaques. the only exception was an unusual animal that failed to produce a take following immunization. there are two confirmed accessible to prevent smallpox in the usa, such as acam2000 and jynneos. smallpox vaccinations show an effective defense that may be used to reduce the prevalence of monkeypox. the replication-competent, second-generation vaccinations, however, are not allowed since smallpox vaccines have side effects. the choice of antigens, vaccine platforms, vaccination regimens, and routes are all aspects of vaccine design. the relative immunogenic potency of vaccine-derived viral antigens, whether an immune adjuvant is necessary, and the type of protective immunity all depend on the vaccine platform selected. these characteristics also affect if a vaccine is appropriate for a particular immunization method and whether a prime-boost vaccination schedule is necessary to promote vaccine-mediated protective immunity and its longevity. additionally, choosing a respiratory mucosal vaccination route or a live attenuated viral vaccine will require more rigorous safety testing. however, the vaccinia vaccine or the newer jynneos ring vaccination approach may be helpful for early-identified close contacts. due to the extended incubation period of mpox, early immunization may decrease symptoms or potentially prevent the illness. although current vaccinations give cross-protection against mpox, they are not specific for the pathogenic virus. their effectiveness in light of the recent multi-country epidemic remains to be determined. furthermore, due to the elimination and halt of smallpox immunizations for four decades, mpox found a way to re-emerge, albeit with new features. in this part, we will look at some examples of how application types of vaccination platforms have been used to successfully induce distinct immune responses in preventive regimens against mpox infection. it is possible to classify the vaccine development platforms as either “traditional”, “recently licensed”, or “not yet licensed”.table 1the production method of first-, second-, and third-generation smallpox vaccines.table 1vaccine generationname of vaccinesthe production method of vaccinereffirst-generationdryvaxa live vacv preparation made from calf lymph is called dryvax®. lyophilization is used to purify, concentrate, and dry the calf lymph. in government vaccine stockpiles, a more recent vaccine made in labs is replacing the antigen extracted by scraping viruses from the skin of diseased calves.aventis pasteur smallpox vaccine another replication-competent vacv vaccine with a projected similar safety profile to acam2000® is apsv, held in the strategic national stockpile. currently, research is being done on vaccination. if acam2000® becomes unavailable, is challenging to procure, or is contraindicated for a specific person, apsv would be made accessible under an ind or eua for use in the case of a smallpox emergency.second-generationacam2000a clonally purified master seed stock of the vaccinia virus, derived from the strain of vaccinia used by the new york city board of health, is used to create it in cell culture. without the intrinsic mutations associated with serial replication, the clonally purified master seed ensures a more uniform vaccine, and the cell culture restricts accidental and bacterial contamination in vaccine manufacture.lister strain isolate of vaccinia in rabbit kidney cells thus, using rabbit kidney cells, the first second-generation lister-based vaccine, rivm, was created in 1960. no additional passages were carried out during the creation of this vaccine; the virus was transferred directly from the calf lymph vaccine to cells. similar take rates and neutralizing abs were seen with the freeze-dried vaccine and the calf lymph-derived vaccine. in clinical trials, this vaccine was used in the netherlands and indonesia without leading to serious side effects.elstree-bnbavarian nordic's lister strain-based elstree-bn vaccine demonstrated safety and immunogenicity in monkey and human clinical studies beginning in 2004. the embryonic cells of chickens were used in the experiment. similarly, a vaccine was developed in japan utilizing chicken embryo fibroblast cells before smallpox was eliminated; although its safety profile was adequate, its effectiveness was not.,, ]vacv lister/cepsanofi pasteur created a second-generation vacv vaccination by undergoing three passages in chicken embryonic primary cells using a batch of the first-generation lister vaccine. regarding immunogenicity and safety, lister/cep was comparable to the original first-generation lister vaccination.third-generationimvamunethe dermal vaccinia strain ankara ) is used to create modified vaccinia ankara; it was first isolated from a lesion on a horse and is now housed at the vaccination institution ankara in ankara, turkey. although initially developed to protect cattle against opxvs, mva has currently been researched as a main vaccination booster for at-risk human populations using the first generation of smallpox vaccine. over 570 consecutive passages in primary chick embryo fibroblast cells suppressed mva.lc16m8on chorioallantois membranes, a clone of lc16 that produced small pocks, a trait associated with reduced growth capacity in mammalian tissues, was chosen to minimize the possibility of autoinoculation complications brought on by a prolonged pock reaction. in the primary rabbit kidney, the virus was passed through six more times at a low temperature before growing on cam. small pocks were isolated and designated lc16mo.. the lc16mo clones were grown on cam and passed through three additional prk cell passages before being chosen for small pocks. the last attenuated clone, designated as lc16m8.fig. 6infection with mpox and several vaccination platforms.fig. 6 traditional vaccine methods for monkeypox conventional vaccines contain live vaccinia strains, live attenuated strains defective in one or more viral genes, and inactivated vaccines. the lv vaccines utilized in the extirpation attempts were not without adverse events and problems. they are among the most reactogenic of all fda-accepted vaccines. from a biodefense point of view, these vaccine harmlessness worries would be of secondary importance to the need to rapidly and effectively break the chain of transmission and include the prevalence. three smallpox vaccines are currently available in the national pharmaceutical stockpile of the united states: jynneostm, acam2000®, and the aventis pasteur smallpox vaccine, which could be used for smallpox under an ind protocol. inactivated vaccines since more than a century ago, inactivated vaccines have created immunity against viral infections. historically, purified inactivated viruses have been used to develop vaccinations. these vaccines have been proven to be both safe and effective at preventing illnesses brought on by viruses like the poliovirus and the influenza virus. compared to their live counterparts, this well-established method of vaccine manufacture is relatively easy to do and has a higher safety profile. to create significant amounts of antigen, the pathogen must first be grown on a substrate, a typical manufacturing process for all inactivated viral vaccines. these regrettable occurrences serve as a caution to all vaccine developers: viral epitopes required for induction of protective immunity should be conserved after inactivation since pathogen inactivation does not always translate into a vaccine that, by default, induces protective immunity. vaccines against inactivated viruses comprise whole viruses that have undergone chemical or thermal treatment. the surface proteins are denaturized by heat and chemicals like phenol and formaldehyde, rendering them inactive and non-infectious. some epitopes remain unaffected by the treatment of the entire virus, maintaining some of their integrity and triggering the production of abs to elicit an adaptive immune response. when a virus is injected, phagocytic immature dendritic cells break it into smaller antigenic fragments. these antigenic fragments are then presented as antigens on the surface of mhc cells, activating b cells and t helper cells. inactivated vaccines are risk-free and do not cause any side effects. since they cannot reproduce, they are heat-stable, non-infectious, and disease-transmissible. to induce a robust enough immune response, booster doses may sometimes be required since they are inadequate as a single dose and typically do not confer immunity for the same period as live vaccinations. live attenuated vaccines live attenuated vaccines have prevented more viral infections than other vaccines in history, and most current human vaccines for viral infections are safe la vaccines. la vaccines can inhibit completely viral diseases and outbreaks of related viruses and their variants. this vaccine method suppresses the appearance of vaccine‐escape and virulence‐increasing variants and preserves immunologically abnormal persons better in general. la vaccines against human viral infections have been among the most effective and economical therapies in medical history. in most parts of the globe, measles is under control, poliomyelitis is on the verge of extinction, and smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980. using la viruses, produced by infecting and replicating inside cultured cells, is an efficient means of stopping the spread of several viral illnesses. however, empirical attenuation may be iffy, and lavs raise safety issues. to some extent, inactivated viruses and subunit vaccines address these issues, although they are still less effective than lavs. successful usage of live vaccinia vaccines suggests that they may be utilized without further phase iii testing. while the hazards have been studied and may be acceptable in the case of an epidemic, the formulation of the presently marketed items differs from the original product. it may need further stability and safety testing. large safety databases exist for the la lc16m8 and replication-defective vaccinia, which have been shown to protect nonhuman primates from the mpox challenge. lc16m8 a live, attenuated, cell-cultured smallpox vaccine called lc16m8 was developed in japan in the 1970s to replace first-generation vaccines like the lister and dryvax strains, which have rare but severe side effects. there were no adverse severe responses in a clinical study involving 10,578 of the almost 50,000 kids who got the lc16m8 immunization. both immunogenicity and efficacy were on par with first-generation vaccinations. because of its decreased virulence and replication competence, lc16m8 is a promising vaccine. an essential ev antigen, b5r, undergoes a frameshift mutation that causes the production of a shortened protein, which reduces the strain's pathogenicity. however, serious side effects such as encephalitis, encephalopathy, widespread and generalized vaccinia, ocular vacv infections, and cardiac dysfunction have been recorded in recipients and are very worrying. as a result, lc16m8 is seen as a possible replacement for the vacv vaccinations that are already available. a single lc16m8 vaccine protects nhps against mpox infection. post-exposure vaccination with lc16m8 for mpox-infected nhps improved clinical manifestation, but all naïve individuals were practically deadly. lc16m8 vaccination 7 days before the mpox challenge protected nhps against mpox. this vaccine has been utilized mainly in japan, and 2 current investigations in japan and the usa showed no safety concerns. however, present appropriation policies have concentrated on inactivated-virus vaccines; other countermeasures, including antiviral drugs and live-virus vaccines, also need proportionated appropriation. significantly, lc16m8 is stocked in japan, where it has been approved and effectively utilized for vaccinating non-immunocompromised persons, such as children. acam2000™ acam2000, a second-generation vaccination with a higher level of safety than first-generation vaccines, is likewise based on live varv. for use against mpox, this vaccine is presently accessible in the us thanks to an extended access investigational new drug application. the smallpox vaccine acam2000™ is produced utilizing cutting-edge cell culture technology and is derived from dryvax®. acam2000 has been associated with severe adverse reactions, just like the original vaccination. when given within three days of contact, smallpox vaccination post-exposure prevention is thought to be 80–93% effective in preventing varv infection. however, its efficiency quickly dwindles following the onset of smallpox clinical signs. each vacv-based vaccine has been shown to produce potent t-cell responses and significant levels of neutralizing abs while having different safety and replication characteristics. the finding that vaccinia immune globulin may reduce vaccine side effects and can guard against smallpox infection emphasizes the significance of abs in immunity. additionally, whereas vaccine-induced abs alone are adequate for mpox challenge protection, abs are necessary for the rhesus macaque mpox infection model. in one phase i clinical study, one of the two phase ii trials, and both phase iii trials, the acam2000tm vaccine produced a poorer ab response than dryvax®. although the titer of neutralizing abs increased by a factor of four after acam2000tm vaccination, it was still roughly 40% lower than in those who had received the dryvax® vaccine. post-exposure administration of tecovirimat alone or in combination with acam2000 protects against a fatal mpox challenge, even if treatment initiation is delayed to the point where vaccination with acam2000 alone does not protect from severe mpox disease and mortality. that immunity acquired from surviving the initial mpox exposure due to treatment with tecovirimat is long-lasting and effective. acam2000 adverse events comprise fundamental symptoms, including fever, malaise, headache, muscle pain, and adenopathy. acute adverse events are infrequent but may happen, including skin infection, vaccinia gangrenosa, generalized vaccinia, stevens-johnson syndrome, inflammatory cardiomyopathy, idiopathic pericarditis, post-vaccination encephalitis, acute brain failure, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis have been reported. jynneos™ jynneos, a more recent vaccination that also goes by the names imvamune and imvanex, gives protection against opxv and may be administered to immunocompromised people without risk. the jynneos™ smallpox/mpox vaccine is created using attenuated live vacv and cannot cause smallpox, mpox, or any other infectious illness. in 2020–2021, advisory committee on immunization practices examined the evidence supporting the use of jynneos, a vacv vaccine with replication defects, in place of acam2000. the acip voted overwhelmingly in support of jynneos as a replacement for acam2000 for the first immunization and booster shots in november 2021. two vaccines are now available and advised for preexposure prophylaxis against opxv infection in persons at risk for such exposures due to these recommendations for using jynneos. third-generation smallpox vaccine imvamune has undergone testing in hiv-positive and atopic dermatitis-prone individuals. furthermore, various research using animal models have shown that protection against mpox is also possible. the risk/benefit ratio has been considerably shifted by the discovery of third-generation vaccinations with superior safety profiles, making them currently practical for mpox prevention. however, since they were created after eradicating smallpox, their capacity to stop natural human opxv infections has never been shown. investigations revealed that a standard dosage of imvamune injected subcutaneously was safe and well tolerated. more significant ab responses and the highest number of responders were produced by a double dosage of imvamune on day 28 instead of day 7. by day 14, after the double dosage, ifn-y elispot responses for groups 0 + 28 and 0 + 7 were similar. modified vaccinia ankara-bavarian nordic is given subcutaneously via injection and is often well tolerated. it may induce injection site responses and minor systemic adverse effects similar to other vaccinations. the fda has given the jynneos vaccine nonreplicating vaccine protection against smallpox and mpox. the jynneos and acam2000 vaccines, however, pose different difficulties. the acam2000 vaccine is a single vaccination that has can potentially cause severe adverse effects. in contrast, the jynneos vaccine is administered as a 2-dose regimen with a mild side effect profile. however, vaccination with acam2000 may be an option in areas that urgently require mpox vaccinations due to ongoing jynneos shortages that are impeding pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis efforts. it is still unknown whether either vaccine will be effective in the current outbreak. in a novel investigation, researchers evaluated and compared the effectiveness of both vaccines versus each other and other vaccines on the market. they observed that using jynneos vaccines led to a better humoral immune response than acam2000. moreover, although the information was not statistically considerable, researchers showed that acam2000 led to more side effects, including myocarditis, than mva. the non-replicating character of jynneos inhibits the incidence of the side effects detected with other vaccines. aventis pasteur smallpox vaccine the aventis pasteur smallpox vaccine is a second-generation smallpox vaccine that is replication-competent. it is predicted that apsv will have a comparable effectiveness and safety profile as acam2000. a vacv seed from the new york city board of health strain creates the apsv. to make the vaccine, live vacv is combined with 50% glycerol, 0.4% phenol, and 0.00017% brilliant green. in those who have never had poxvirus, the apsv vaccination is more than 95% effective. it is anticipated that the safety profiles of apsv and acam2000 would be comparable. it is less likely that young people who got the first dose of the smallpox vaccination from the nycboh strain of vacv may have serious side outcomes, but it is still possible. the three most frequent severe side effects from vaccination are encephalitis, increasing vaccinia, and vaccinatum eczema. similar to acam2000, it was anticipated that apsv would increase the risk of myopericarditis. when acam2000 is unavailable or inappropriate, the us fda has granted apsv an ind or emergency use authorization for use in specific cases. apsv could be utilized with an ind use when neither of the licensed vaccines are accessible. however, it is not recognized how efficient the apsv is versus mpox. previous investigations with other orthopoxviruses have demonstrated that smallpox drugs, including brincidofovir and cidofovir, could be utilized to treat mpox. however like the apsv, there is a science gap about their efficacy against mpox. dryvax one of the interferences for blocking and regulating mpox is vacv, first developed against smallpox. the three primary vacv-based vaccination types are as follows. first-generation vaccinations include live vacv, such as dryvax, used to eradicate smallpox in the previous century. dryvax, a live vacv smallpox vaccine, protects against both smallpox and mpox but should not be administered to those with impaired immune systems. a safe subunit protein-based vaccination that can elicit a protective ab response might be used instead of a live virus vaccine since abs to vacv mediate protection. smallpox vaccinations traditionally made from calf lymph and used to eradicate the disease, like dryvax, are based on replicating vacv. despite their excellent efficacy, they may have uncommon but serious adverse effects, especially in those with impaired immune systems. the adverse reactions are stevens-johnson syndrome, myo/pericarditis, fetal vaccinia, encephalitis, progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, and occasionally death. this vaccine has several side effects, such as generalized vaccinia, ocular vaccinia, and eczema vaccinatum, happened rarely, and deadly developing vaccinia related to immunodeficiency, postvaccinal encephalitis, and embryonic vaccinia during early pregnancy occurred infrequently. inflammatory cardiomyopathy, coronary heart disease, and idiopathic cardiomyopathy were newly identified side effects of smallpox vaccination. clone 3 was particularly harmful in animal studies and was generated from dryvax, the vaccine most widely used in the united states during the smallpox extirpation effort. researchers found that their differential in pathogenicity may be attributed to the full-length ifn-α/β decoy receptor in clone 3 and a truncated receptor in the clone used for the second-generation smallpox vaccine acam2000. when given to mice through intranasal, intraperitoneal, or intracranial injection, viruses expressing the full-length decoy receptor were more lethal than acam2000, and infection was made worse by t cell depletion. therefore, smallpox vaccinations with high rates of adverse effects and a dryvax clone obtained from a lesion in a patient with advanced vaccinia both have the full-length decoy receptor. novel vaccine method every vaccination works on the fundamental tenet that the vaccine may trigger an immune response faster than the pathogen. even though traditional immunizations gave animals the ability to create powerful neutralizing and preservative abs, these vaccines are allergenic, expensive, and time-consuming. they suggest the in vitro growth of harmful viruses, raising serious safety concerns. therefore, a safe and efficient vaccine should be produced to inhibit mpox. unlike conventional vaccinations, novel vaccine generation is highly secure and affordable. moreover, licensed vaccines and several other vaccine candidates are at different levels of progression. however, it will need accurate assessments to certify that they stimulate immunity equivalent to traditional mpox vaccines. to solve this problem, further tests require to be done to refine animal models for the evaluation of novel vaccines, as animal investigations utilizing several poxviruses can generate inconsistent outcomes, and non-human primate models do not entirely recapitulate human exposure to mpox. new vaccine methods against mpox include virus-like particles, recombinant protein, nucleic acid, and nanoparticle-based vaccines. protein subunit vaccine for monkeypox infection these difficulties may be solved by subunit vaccinations built on microbe fragments. only the pathogen antigenic components necessary to elicit efficient immune responses are included in subunit vaccinations. an antigen may be a polysaccharide, a nucleic acid, or a protein. the antigenicity of the vaccine's ingredients is a significant barrier to developing safe, effective vaccines. adjuvants are now essential parts of many vaccines and help to maximize the vaccine's protective effect by lengthening and intensifying immune responses. recent research has concentrated on a novel class of adjuvants targeting innate immune cells' pattern recognition receptors. targeting specific innate pathways with adjuvants has improved ab and t cell responses. innate immune cells are important immune system modulators because they orchestrate adaptive immunity responses. since recombinant protein or peptide vaccines often produce suboptimal immune responses, there is an urgent need for safe and effective vaccine adjuvants that boost immunization efficiency. examples of approved vaccine adjuvants include inorganic aluminium salts, the oil-in-water emulsion mf59, monophosphoryl lipid a absorbed on aluminium salts, and the toll-like receptor 9 agonist cpg. tlr agonists have also been studied as vaccine adjuvants, along with cytosolic pattern recognition receptor activators such as stimulators of interferon genes agonists. according to a notion, vaccination adjuvants that imitate natural diseases, such as live attenuated vaccines, may activate innate immune-sensing pathways to create potent and long-lasting immune responses. subunit vaccines containing the membrane proteins a33, b5, l1, a27, and alum cpg were tested on primates for the etiology of smallpox. then, a lethal dosage of mpox was administered intravenously to the primates. whereas adjuvanted alum vaccinations only exhibited little protection, those with adjuvant cpg added provided complete protection and a more uniform ab response and more significant igg1 responses. these results provide encouraging evidence for developing a highly effective subunit vaccine against opxv infections as a safer alternative to live vacv immunization. in a study, two doses of an adjuvanted protein-based subunit vaccination protected nhp from a fatal mpox challenge. in an investigation to identify typical 9-mer antigenic epitopes, the mpox genome-encoded proteins were examined. the epitopes having the highest antigenic score among these were then selected for use in vaccine construction. the potential vaccine candidate was also characterized and validated using several in silico approaches, and research was done to get a better understanding of the molecular interaction with the human tlr4/md2 complex. in conclusion, researchers applied a machine learning technique to assess the immunological simulation profile of this new peptide-based vaccination in the mammalian immune system. with no reported adverse effects, this novel vaccine candidate has shown protection against mpox and may be employed shortly. reverse vaccinology, along with other bioinformatics and immunoinformatic tools, have been used in recent research to create a vaccine against mpox that specifically targets numerous viral proteins. the cupin domain-containing protein, the abc transporter atp-binding protein, and the duf192 domain-containing protein were all examined for their antigenic potential as extracellular proteins. b and t-cell epitopes were predicted from selected proteins to induce cellular and humoral immunity. the simulation findings showed a higher positive response from b and t cells after the immunization phase. in-depth computational modeling demonstrated that the suggested vaccine would stimulate an effective immune response against mpox infection, giving it a promising prospect for future clinical trials. researchers showed that the appropriate mhc-i, mhc-ii, and b-cell epitopes were chosen to develop multi-epitope vaccination constructions connected with acceptable linkers and adjuvants to increase immune responses to vaccine designs. the most promising epitopes discovered bound to mhc-i and mhc-ii alleles were also found to have high binding affinities and low binding energies between −7.0 and −8.6 kcal/mol. study results from immunological simulations indicate that immunization induced a protective immune response against mpox. finally, the suggested vaccination was stable against the mhc-i allele in a dynamic molecular study, exhibiting low root mean square fluctuations values. according to the researchers of this study, an essential protein in mpox pathogenesis is the cell surface-binding protein. due to its potential safety and effectiveness, vaccination using replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus vaccines may be preferred to live vacv vaccination. six distinct poxvirus glycoproteins, all of which are present on the surface of infectious vacv, were delivered as rad vaccines to mice. a deadly intranasal challenge with vacv was avoided four weeks after mice received a single intramuscular injection of rad encoding a27l. remarkable reductions in post-challenge morbidity were seen by week 10 post-vaccination, and these improvements were linked to the development of neutralizing solid ab responses and the induction of individual polyfunctional t cell responses. rad-a27l vaccination was highly immunogenic and protective for at least 35 weeks post-vaccination. therefore, the mortality and morbidity caused by poxvirus infection are likely preventable with a single-dose subunit vaccine expressing a poxvirus protein. in a study, researchers developed mrna and multi-epitopes vaccines vs. mpox using structural vaccinology and proteomics methodologies. to create mvc and mrna-based vaccines, 9 cytotoxic t lymphocytes, 6 b cells, and 5 helper t lymphocyte epitopes were linked using the suitable linkers. the results of immune induction showed that the antigen titer after administration peaked on day five and that a sharp decline in antigen titer was observed upon the production of igm, igg, igm + igg, dendritic cells, ifn-γ, and il, demonstrating the ability of this vaccine to elicit an immune response against mpox. virus-like particles for monkeypox infection vlps are particles that self-assemble because of the expression of proteins encoding viral capsids, cores, or envelopes, or even preparations of monolayered particles obtained from a multilayered virus. vlps have a unique mix of high immunogenicity and outstanding safety characteristics, making them suitable platforms for vaccine development. since the first description of vlp-based hepatitis e virus vaccines, the field has made significant progress, and vlps are now the foundation of many marketed vaccines, including those against human papillomavirus, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis e virus. foreign epitopes, such as those from nonstructural viral proteins or nonviral proteins, will be attached to or shown on the vlp in the future. the antigen delivery and the vlp's capacity to induce immune solid responses make for a powerful treatment strategy. almost any platform may be used to make vlps, and many different antigens can be attached to them, so the results frequently seem promising at first. naïve and immune individuals have had severe side effects after receiving the traditional vacv-based smallpox vaccination. despite the absolute risk of the illness and the known risks of the vaccination, there have been conversations about restoring live-vaccine injection because of the concern that it may be used as a biological weapon. during the vaccination drive in the united states before the iraq war, serious safety issues about the live vacv vaccine were uncovered. weak immunogenicity or using bacterial toxins as adjuvants in current killed-virus vaccine formulations for mucosal delivery leads to inflammation and autoimmune reactions. smallpox vaccination of the mucosa was studied using a nanoscale oil-in-water emulsion as a formulation for the killed virus. this study analyzed the immunogenicity and effectiveness of a nanoemulsions adjuvant mixed with vacv purified from tissue culture as a possible smallpox vaccine. their findings showed that ne inactivates vacv and that when administered to the nares of mice, this combination produces protective mucosal and systemic immunity. in conclusion, the study's authors established that a modified version of ne-inactivated vacv is an efficient mucosal vaccination that stimulates the development of ab in the mucosa, as well as systemic ab and th-1 cellular immunity. by mixing ne with the purified virus, this prototype vaccine is easy to produce and has the potential to be safer than live-viral immunization. blue water vaccines inc., a biopharmaceutical company working on transformational vaccines to solve major global health problems, announced plans to look into the possibility of making a new mpx vaccine using its norovirus shell and protrusion vlp platform. for example, bwv-101 for influenza, bwv-301 for gastroenteritis brought on by norovirus or rotavirus infection, and bwv-302 for malaria are all being developed using the company's s&p platform. in this new initiative, bwv will try to offer mpox antigens inside the s&p platform to create a vaccine candidate that might shield people against mpox. nucleic acid vaccines it is anticipated that vaccination-induced immunity would focus on the native antigens that diseases express. therefore, it is crucial to produce vaccine antigens that are identical to natural antigens immunologically. dna, mrna, or recombinant viral vector vaccines are examples of nucleic acid vaccines that inject the genetic material encoding the antigenic protein for the host to express. due to the host posttranslational alterations these proteins will experience, host glycosylation may change the antigen's structure and immunological effectiveness. dna-based vaccine for monkeypox infection due to their lack of replication, dna-based vaccinations have a good safety profile. in comparison to alternative methods, such as inactivated viral vaccinations, dna vaccines offer the following advantages: they can be generated fast at a large scale, are simple and quick to make using synthetic or polymerase chain reaction techniques, are safer than other methods, and are more thermostable than other forms of vaccines. additionally, dna-based vaccinations do not need to be kept in a cold chain, which makes them a fantastic substitute for the lack of vital, life-saving vaccines in places with limited resources. complementary dnas encoding desired immunogens are cloned into eukaryotic expression plasmids using recombinant dna technology. after being purified and amplified in bacteria, vaccine plasmids are then administered directly to the host being immunized. dna-based vaccines offer both benefits and drawbacks compared to classic immunization techniques. the immunogen's capacity to be presented by both mhc-i and ii molecules is its primary immunological benefit. highly active expression vectors based on those created for synthesizing recombinant proteins are used to get the most extraordinary immune responses. dna vaccines have been explored against various viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections due to their simplicity in development and testing,, ]. rhesus macaques were immunized by intradermal and intramuscular injection with the mpox orthologs of the vacv l1r, a27l, a33r, and b5r proteins, either alone or in combination with the corresponding recombinant proteins produced in escherichia coli. they found that animals given just dna had trouble producing significant titers. skin lesions appeared after the challenge and disappeared similarly to placebo controls. the protein-vaccinated animals, however, suffered from mild to severe sickness, yet they lived. dna-vaccinated and protein-boost recipients had mild diseases with no lesions or fewer lesions that cleared up within days. dna/protein vaccination resulted in th responses as well as binding ab titers to all four proteins, and these responses were inversely related to the total number of lesions. only a few numbers of linear b cell epitopes that are highly conserved across opxvs were identified by the sera of the inoculated macaques. their finding might direct future work on creating mpox and smallpox vaccinations that are easier, safer, and more efficient. in a separate study, scientists created the dna vaccine 4pox, which shielded nhp from the severe illness caused by mpox. the protective efficacy of the 4pox dna vaccine was tested in rabbits by challenging them with aerosolized rabbitpox virus. this model mimics the respiratory route of exposure and low dose associated with natural smallpox exposure in humans. researchers showed that after receiving the 4pox vaccination, rabbits did not exhibit any clinical symptoms and produced immunogen-specific abs, including neutralizing abs, demonstrating protection against rpxv aerosol. on the other hand, unvaccinated animals showed significant disease symptoms, such as lesions, and were put down. these findings indicate the protective potential of an unformulated, non-adjuvanted dna vaccine given intramuscularly. researchers found that a synthetic, multivalent, highly concentrated dna vaccine may induce polyvalent immunity in macaques and provide defense against a highly pathogenic mpox challenge. the vaccine is given via a unique, less invasive skin ep microarray. it has never been documented how such a varied, high-titer ab response may be elicited against several dna-encoded antigens administered concurrently in micro volumes. researchers vaccinated cynomolgus macaques with multivalent smallpox dna vaccine through the intradermal or intramuscular route to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods. they kept an eye on the scope, character, and effectiveness of the vaccine-induced response to ensure that it offered protection during a fatal mpox challenge. furthermore, they noted that the vaccination could stimulate an ab response that was broadly and powerfully binding and neutralizing, comparable to the reaction elicited by dryvax. additionally, solid cellular immunity was seen. a deadly poxvirus challenge in macaques was significantly impacted by the mix of immunological responses. mrna-based vaccine for monkeypox infection research has shown that the mrna therapy's prototype, direct mrna injection, expresses specific proteins that cause an immune response. with their high potency, possibility for safe delivery, cheap production costs, and capacity for rapid development, rna-based vaccines offer several benefits over conventional vaccination techniques. according to reports, the mrna-based vaccination induces a more significant cd4+ or cd8+ t cell response than protein immunization. clinical trials have shown that the two most used mrna vaccines are safe and effective against sars-cov-2 and its various mutations. to prevent another possibly catastrophic viral outbreak and all the severe health and economic impacts that would follow, it would be more accessible and purely based on the information gathered by the covid-19 mrna vaccines to build mrna vaccinations for mpox. the only immunization authorized by the us food and drug administration is modified vaccinia ankara-bavarian nordic. however, in the case of an mpox epidemic, the acam2000® smallpox vaccination and the experimental aventis pasteur smallpox vaccine will be accessible. in a study, scientists used the mrna sequences of chimeric monoclonal abs against the mv, c7d11, and the ev, c8a and c6c types of poxviruses, as well as those made by chimpanzees and humans. the safety and efficacy of using unmodified mrna that encodes the mabs c8a, c6c, and c7d11 in preventing smallpox infection were tested in a relatively large laboratory animal. investigators used a mouse vacv model to choose monoclonal ab target levels that showed therapeutic efficacy, in vitro translation, secretion, and biological activity of mrna constructs. only one day after giving rabbits an injection of a lipid nanoparticle encasing mrna, they found c7d11, c8a, and c6c in their blood. combining three lnp-created mrna constructs that encode distinct abs led to serum levels almost identical to those attained when each construct was given alone. their results provide some of the first evidence that numerous abs may be generated via mrna constructions in a big, nonrodent species. considering the experimentally set target serum level and the observed decay rate, the ab levels attained were, therefore, unlikely to provide protection. two mpox quadrivalent lipid-based nanoparticle mrna vaccines were created by researchers as part of a study. these vaccinations were created using the specific mpox antigens a29l, a35r, m1r, and b6r. mice are stimulated to produce mpox-specific igg and vacv-specific neutralizing abs by administering mrna-a-lnp and mrna-b-lnp twice intramuscularly. in addition, these vaccines induce effective mpox, particularly th-1 biased cellular immune response, also persisting effector memory t and germinal center b cell reactions in mice. a double injection of mrna-a-lnp and mrna-b-lnp protects animals against the vacv challenge. additionally, the passive transfer of sera from mice immunized with mrna-a-lnp and mrna-b-lnp protects naked animals against the vacv challenge. these mrna-based vaccinations seem to be effective and safe against mpox epidemics as well as against outbreaks brought on by other orthopoxviruses, such as the smallpox virus. in the usa, researchers created the polyvalent mrna vaccine mpxvac-097 against mpox and tested the immunogenicity of the vaccine in mice. using 2a peptides and codon optimization, five mpox viral antigens—a29l, e8l, m1r, a35r, and b6r—were connected in tandem. this vaccine induces widespread neutralizing abs, mpox-particular t cell reaction, and preservation versus vaccinia virus challenge. administration of mpxvac-097 did not produce considerable pathological alterations in mice. viral vector vaccines for monkeypox infection recombinant viral vectors have been employed to convey specific disease antigens for more than 40 years. the first viral vector carrying a foreign gene was built on the sv40 virus in 1972. viral vectors have some benefits over conventional subunit vaccines, one of which is that they trigger not only robust ab responses but also cellular reactions that are essential for destroying pathogen-infected cells. viral vectors may also produce long-lasting immune responses, in some situations, after only one dose, as well as solid immunogenicity without needing an adjuvant. moreover, it is possible to build viral vectors to deliver vaccination antigens to particular cells or tissues. there is still room to increase immunogenicity despite the licensed viral vector vaccines' good immunogenicity and effectiveness. genetic or molecular adjuvants may be a helpful strategy, particularly with vaccination vectors that only trigger mild or short transgene expression. in addition, it has been shown that heterologous prime-boost regimens, which combine different viral vectors or technologies, such as mrna vaccines, enhance the immunogenicity of homologous regimens, and they are likely to play a significant role in viral vector vaccine regimens in the future.table 2novel mpox vaccines in the development

against a fatal mpox challenge. additionally, it might be utilized to immunize those who reject vacv and to establish baseline protection against the poxvirus safely.protein subunit vaccine10 epitopes containing 147 amino acid residues, the padre sequence, the ctxb adjuvant, and the necessary peptide linker. the adjuvant and the eaaak peptide linker are incorporated into the vaccine's n-terminal end. the padre sequence, which serves as a helper t cell epitope for triggering the ctl response in response to various antigens, was also connected to the eaaak linker.in silico studythe mpox epitopic vaccine design has shown excellently defined features regarding antigenicity, non-allergenicity, and physicochemical properties. the vaccine was produced using whole-genome-encoded proteins. researchers might thus conclude that the vaccine architecture they created is not only optimal but also efficient and secure to administer against mpox.protein subunit vaccinein a multi-epitope vaccination, the epitopes were linked by “gpgpg” linkers and to the adjuvant for cholera toxin b by another eaaak linker.immunoinformatic and molecular docking studiesthe modeling of the immune system revealed that the vaccination component stimulated more robust responses from both b and t cells. to induce an immune response against mpox, a novel risk-free and nearly symptom-free multi-epitope vaccination has been developed that target explicitly three potentially antigenic extracellular proteins.protein subunit vaccinemhc-i, mhc-ii, and b-cell epitopesin silico studya specific immune response to the mpox was discovered to be elicited by the vaccination, according to immunological simulation studies. the dynamic molecular investigation, which concludes, demonstrates that the

dna and boosted with proteins had minor illnesses with no lesions or fewer lesions that went away in a matter of days. th responses and binding ab titers to all four proteins were induced by dna/protein vaccination, and these responses were adversely linked with the overall number of lesions. only a few numbers of linear b cell epitopes that are highly conserved across opxvs were identified by the sera of the inoculated macaques.dna vaccinea27, f9, h3, and l1 are the mv-neutralizing ab targets in the plasmid cocktail. researchers also incorporated the ev antigens a33, a56, and b5. in an mpox challenge model, the core antigen a4 was also used to increase the impact of cytotoxic t lymphocytes.animal study: cynomolgus macaquesthese findings show a considerable increase in the dna vaccine platform's effectiveness, producing immune responses that resemble those of live viral infections. they are considered relevant for developing vaccines against difficult-to-treat human and animal illnesses.mrna vaccineunmodified mrna that encodes three mabs, c8a, c6c, and c7d11.animal study: rabbitswhen the three lnp-formulated mrna constructs encoding the three different abs were injected together, the resulting blood levels were almost equal to those obtained when each construct was treated separately. based on the experimentally established target serum level and the observed decay rate, the ab levels achieved were not expected to offer protection. nanovaccine in recent years, proteins have been found in multiple copies on various nanoparticle types, including metals, polymers, lipids, and others, to extend half-life, promote a deposit effect, or primarily activate specific immune cells. the usage of protein-only nanovaccines produced by recombinant protein self-assembly, on the other hand, has been around for a while and offers a technique to meet the specifications of the ideal vaccine formulation. additionally, it avoids employing non-protein nanoparticles as carriers, which might be problematic if using xenobiotic, resistant, or poorly biocompatible materials because of potential adverse effects. an appropriate nanovaccine design aims to induce an efficient adaptive immune response that results in immunological memory. this describes a very long-lived surveillance system of specialized memory b cells that may accumulate many plasma cells via rapid clonal proliferation before maturing into cells able to produce particular ab in response to pathogen exposure. these specific abs ought to neutralize the virus and ultimately lead to viral clearance by preventing it from interacting with the host cell. the activation of cytotoxic cd8+ t cells is necessary for the elimination of virus-infected host cells in addition to the creation of neutralizing abs. the viral vaccines that are live-attenuated and inactivated may be seen as nanoparticles in and of themselves. a viral or non-viral nanoparticle may be a nanocarrier to encapsulate or convey the antigen payload or nucleic acid encoding the antigen rather than acting as the vaccine itself. nanocarriers may impart intrinsic adjuvant behavior and offer stability when delivering these payloads to antigen-presenting cells. target immune cells get both the antigen and the adjuvant simultaneously, thanks to nanocarriers. furthermore, not utilizing the nanoparticle antiviral vaccines frequently needs the help of adjuvants to trigger the immune systems successfully. virosome- and lipid-based nanoparticle vaccines were evaluated in the face of viral infection and demonstrated potential effectiveness in the human body. several studies have supported the promising efficacy of nanovaccines versus viral infections. such a study can be utilized to produce a nanovaccine that could inhibit the outbreak of the mpox while enhancing the immune reaction, especially with nanoparticles improving the delivery yield, delivering adjuvants, and slowly releasing packed factors,,,,, ]. for instance, researchers demonstrated in one study that an mrna-lipid nanoparticle vaccine encoding a collection of four highly preserved mpox surface proteins involved in virus binding, fusion, and transfer can stimulate mpox-specific immunity and heterologous preservation versus a lethal vacv challenge. to the four mpox antigens and the four vacv homologs, mrna vaccination induced more significant fc-effector th1-biased humoral immune responses than mva. it also produced superior neutralizing and cellular spread-inhibitory activities than mpox and vacv. during combinations of two, three, or four mpox antigen-expressing mrnas maintained against infection-related weight loss and death, single mpox antigen mrna vaccines showed relative preservation vs. vacv challenge. due to a combination of neutralizing and non-neutralizing ab activities, cross-conservation through multivalent mpox mrnas was much better than homologous preservation by mva. this material demonstrates essential vacv protection using an mrna-based vaccination that targets four highly protected viral surface antigens together with the induction of highly functional abs to reduce viral infection swiftly. in a different study, scientists created mrna-alab-lnp, a novel poxvirus vaccine that encodes the four vaccinia viral antigens a27, l1, a33, and b5. after a single injection, animals developed potent anti-l1-particular abs and controlled anti-a33, anti-a27, and anti-b5-particular ab responses. following the second injection, the ab responses to all four antigens were noticeably enhanced, with all igg titers above 5 logs and the highest being anti-a33 igg. the high rate of binding abs revealed a significant ability to neutralize the vaccinia virus. exclusive ifn-γ reactions were shown to all four antigens, with the stimulation of the same antigen, a33, eliciting the most robust cellular response. this mrna-lnp vaccine, which encodes four vaccinia antigens, promoted immunity to mpox and the vaccinia virus, suggesting that the mrna-alab may be a contender for future manufacture of a vaccine against infection with mpox, smallpox, and likely additional orthopoxviruses.fig. 7in addition to facilitating effective vaccine delivery to tissues and cells, mpox nanovaccines also allow for the simultaneous delivery of adjuvants and antigens. furthermore, nanovaccines enable the potentiation of immunomodulation by multivalent antigens and, or adjuvants. when compared to conventional formulations, nanotechnology has the potential to increase therapeutic efficacy and change the viral vaccine market significantly.fig. 7 current status of monkeypox vaccines according to the who's proclamation that mpox infection is a public health emergency of global concern, governments must fund early and timely efficacy/effectiveness research and ensure that they are prepared to introduce vaccination as soon as necessary. the who released interim guidelines on june 24, 2022, noting that mass immunization is neither essential nor advised for mpox and encourages the prudent use of presently available vaccinations due to supply constraints. within collaborative vaccine effectiveness studies using standardized protocols and data collection tools, the who emphasizes the importance of supporting vaccination programmed with surveillance and contact tracing, as well as vital public health messaging and robust pharmacovigilance. the recommended postexposure vaccination for mpox prophylaxis is jynneos. the use of vaccinia immune globulin in postexposure prevention for severely immunocompromised individuals who may not establish an adequate immunologic response to jynneos and for whom acam2000 is contraindicated is currently under consideration. if general case prevalence becomes a problem, ensuring prompt and protocolized access to jynneos or vaccinia immune globulin should be a top priority for managing infection in immunocompromised individuals. jynneos, a replication-deficient mva, was suggested as an alternative to acam2000 for primary immunization in the newly released recommendations from the advisory acip in 2022. due to the lack of a significant cutaneous response, the vaccine does not represent a danger for autoinoculation or unintentional inoculation. the vaccination is given in two doses, separated by 28 days. for those who have come into contact with more virulent opxvs, a booster is advised every two years and every ten years for those who have come into contact with less virulent opxvs. the acip also suggested using jynneos as a booster for anyone who has received acam2000 as their primary vaccine. however, the scientists showed in a sero-study that although the illness severity is decreased, childhood immunization against mpox does not entirely protect against it. mva has shown a good safety profile in phase iii clinical assessments, large-scale vaccination investigations are still required, and mva has not been accepted for utilization in the public crowd to inhibit smallpox and mpox infections. furthermore, its cost is also one of the agents to be considered. therefore, acam2000 and mva vaccines are still the more significant elections for postexposure inhibition of mpox and smallpox. however, the availability also the possible safety worries of the acam2000 and mva vaccines are far from the global medical request. significantly, a novel investigation showed that immunization with jynneos stimulated partly low rates of neutralizing abs versus mpox. therefore, a safe, efficient, and available mpox-particular vaccine is immediately required to face the ongoing mpox epidemic. nucleic acid vaccines can safely and efficiently mimic the immunization of inactivated vaccines. furthermore, the large-scale generation of such vaccines is affordable and straightforward. mrna vaccine has been well shown as an efficient method to inhibit viral infections with benefits such as fast and scalable generation, excellent safety profile without nuclear entrance, and the capability to successfully stimulate humoral and cellular immune reactions. several investigations offered the advantage of utilizing lnps as a delivery system for the mrna vaccines since excellent progress was made in mpox inhibition. this is because these nanoparticles are considered a constant delivery method that can protect mrna integrity, preserve their cellular absorption, and improve the yield of their transfer and nucleic acid discharge in the host cells. additionally, issues that may be encountered when developing a nanovaccine for mpox and need to be addressed are vaccine affordability, capability to scale up, and durability in various environments because many mpox patients are in several counties that cannot afford strict storage and transportation requirements. moreover, it is crucial to thoroughly study and evaluate the toxicity, immune responses, and efficacy of nanoparticles on the transferring factor each time a nanovaccine is prepared for the mpox.table 3mpox vaccines in the advanced clinical development phase.table 3vaccine platformvaccine namevaccine

generalized vaccinia, post-vaccinal encephalitis or encephalomyelitis, blindness from autoinoculation, and fetal death in expectant mothers.lc16m18since it was successfully given to more than 50,000 children in the 1970s, lc16m8, an attenuated, replicating smallpox vaccine developed from the lister strain of vaccinia, has been licensed in japan. in nonclinical studies, it was found to have significantly less neurotoxicity than vaccines that had not been attenuated. recent research in two different animal models has shown that lc16m8 is immunogenic after a single dose and has protective efficacy comparable to the only smallpox vaccine approved by the fda.common adverse effects include weariness, pruritus, lymphadenopathy, pain at the injection site, fever, headache, myalgia, and rash.jynneospeople with immune weaknesses may be vaccinated with a live, attenuated, replication-deficient vaccine since it has fewer side effects than some others and no serious adverse events.side effects that are often experienced include myalgia, headaches, tiredness, nausea, and chills. clinical studies did not have a sufficient number of participants 65 years of age and over, which cannot be established by adequate human studies. the human data on expectant mothers that are currently available are insufficient to determine the risks of vaccination during pregnancy, and it is unknown if the vaccine is excreted in human milk. individuals under 18 have not been studied for safety and efficacy. in addition to dna, vlps, replication-competent and replication-defective vectors, and novel protein or gene-based subunit methods, some have shown effectiveness against mpox in nhp. the results of the animal studies demonstrate that smallpox vaccinations induce immunological responses capable of providing significant and often total protection against mpox infection. all of these products will need to undergo a lengthy clinical development procedure that includes determining the protection's level of durability and a thorough safety assessment and formulation considerations to maximize stability. conclusion resources must be gathered to stop the worldwide spread of mpox, a disease that is now relevant and concerning globally. according to data, smallpox vaccination before infection may prevent mpox and alleviate clinical symptoms of illness. infants and young children, pregnant women, and those with impaired immune systems are probably at the most significant risk. the strategic national stockpile of the united states has two antivirals that might be employed, as well as smallpox and mpox vaccinations. only a few other nations have made similar preparations. jynneos, lc16m8, and acam2000 are approved mainly for groups at high risk for exposure to mpox. however, the availability also the possible safety worries of the acam2000 and mva vaccines are far from the global medical request. continuing assessment of available vaccines for safety and effectiveness in preventing mpox is essential. therefore, developing a novel vaccine with a wide range of use potential for mpox and its emerging variants could present a good preventive method to deal with the evolving mpox infection. according to various studies, mrna-based lnp induces more neutralizing abs, more effective mpox-specific t-cell responses, and protection against mpox than traditional vaccine methods. considering that the safety profiles of lnps relate to dose and combination and that long-time side effects, particularly following numerous dose use, cannot be seriously forecasted as data on long-time health results is clearly not accessible yet. more advanced studies should re-assess the disadvantages and advantages ratio before a continuing comprehensive utilization of mrna vaccines in low-risk individuals considered for life-threatening periods. in addition, to recognize the most efficient vaccine between traditional and novel vaccines, it is crucial to assess efficiency, including reactogenicity, cytotoxicity test, safety, and adverse effects, especially for high-risk and vulnerable patients. it is necessary to control and contain the mpox using the lessons learned from the covid-19 pandemic. it is essential to immediately create, produce, and license safe and effective countermeasures as the covid-19 pandemic spreads throughout the world. platforms based on nucleic acids can be ideal for such unanticipated situations. success will be determined over time, but the quick creation and testing of the now fda-approved mrna vaccines are unique. the next stage might be to test and approve preventive or therapeutic effector molecules, like abs, using nucleic acid technology. as shown by sars-cov-2, a responsive platform is probably necessary to keep up with an agent that is continually and quickly changing. the threshold toward such a therapy may be approaching fast, given how swiftly technology is developing in delivery and stability. furthermore, the groundwork for the rapid development of novel vaccine technologies to have an effect during the mpox infection has been laid by breakthroughs in bio/nanotechnology and enhanced nano/manufacturing with open reporting and data sharing. based on the available information, it is still necessary to create a new generation of mpox-specific vaccinations that are safe and efficient and either eradicate the virus or create innovative vaccine platforms before mpox is declared a pandemic. ethics approval statement not applicable. clinical trial registration not

a comprehensive review of monkeypox virus and mpox characteristics abstract monkeypox virus is the etiological agent of monkeypox, a zoonotic disease. mpxv is endemic in the forested regions of west and central africa, but the virus has recently spread globally, causing outbreaks in multiple non-endemic countries. in this paper, we review the characteristics of the virus, including its ecology, genomics, infection biology, and evolution. we estimate by phylogenomic molecular clock that the b.1 lineage responsible for the 2022 mpox outbreaks has been in circulation since 2016. we interrogate the host-virus interactions that modulate the virus infection biology, signal transduction, pathogenesis, and host immune responses. we highlight the changing pathophysiology and epidemiology of mpxv and summarize recent advances in the prevention and treatment of mpox. in addition, this review identifies knowledge gaps with respect to the virus and the disease, suggests future research directions to address the knowledge gaps, and proposes a one health approach as an effective strategy to prevent current and future epidemics of mpox. introduction monkeypox virus is the etiological agent of a zoonotic disease called monkeypox. it is a double-stranded dna virus belonging to orthopoxvirus genus within the poxviridae family and chordopoxvirinae as the subfamily. other members of this genus include variola virus, cowpox virus, vaccinia virus, camelpox virus, taterapox virus and ectromelia virus. mpxv is divided into clade i and clade ii, with clade ii subclassified as clade iia and iib. for five decades, mpxv was endemic in west and central africa, and exportation of the virus to non-endemic regions was rare. however, the incidence of mpox outside endemic regions has increased, and the epidemiological profile of the disease within endemic regions has changed. this may have led to the mpxv emergence and re-emergence in endemic countries in 2022. this paper will cover the current state of knowledge on the characteristics of mpxv and mpox, the infection biology, molecular pathogenesis, and evolution of mpxv as well as the clinical features, diagnosis, epidemiology, and therapeutic options against mpox. in addition, the review will critically interrogate and evaluate the contributions of viral, host, and anthropogenic factors to the emergence and reemergence of mpox across the globe. before 1970, there was no documented report of human mpxv infection, although the virus had previously caused infections in monkeys and apes. infections in monkeys were reported in laboratory/captive animals and were first identified in captive monkeys in denmark in 1958. the first human mpox case emerged in a 9-month-old boy in the democratic republic of the congo in august 1970. subsequently, six additional mpox cases were identified between september 1970 and april 1971 in liberia, sierra leone and nigeria. since then, mpxv has been reported in several countries and is endemic in benin, cameroon, the central african republic, the drc, gabon, ivory coast, liberia, nigeria, the republic of the congo, sierra leone, and south sudan. figure 1 displays the global mpox outbreak timeline. between 1970 and 2021, the cases have been sporadic and geographically limited within endemic regions. notably, the drc is the only country that continuously reports yearly cases of mpox with tropical rainforest regions accounting for 98.7% of all cases pre-2022. in nigeria, sporadic cases were reported in the 1970s; however, re-emergence of the disease started in 2017 with an eleven-year-old boy as the index case in bayelsa state. at the end of 2017, nigeria recorded 88 cases, and during this outbreak, travel-related cases in non-endemic countries were reported, including the united kingdom, the united states of america, israel, and singapore, between 2018 and 2021. the first mpox outbreak in a non-endemic country was reported in 2003 in the usa linked to importation of rodents from ghana. by the end of the outbreak, 47 people had been infected, 2023). there were no other travel-related cases reported until 2018. between 2018 to 2021, 11 travel-related mpox cases were recorded in the uk, singapore, israel, and the usa. of these, four resulted in secondary cases: one healthcare worker in the uk was infected by contaminated bedding, an adult and a child from a family from the uk had a travel history to nigeria, and one traveler to israel who had visited nigeria in 2018. between 2019 and 2021, a total of seven mpox outbreaks occurred outside africa in singapore, the uk and the usa. all travel related cases originated in nigeria, with high-throughput sequencing confirming it as clade ii. between 2017 and october 30, 2022, a total of 830 cases were recorded in 33 out of 36 states in nigeria, 2022). the current global mpox outbreak started in may 2022 and was declared a public health emergency of international concern on july 23, 2022. as of august 02, 2023, there were a total of 88,600 laboratory-confirmed cases and 152 deaths across 113 countries including 106 countries that have not historically reported mpox. the americas recorded the highest number of cases during the 2022 mpox outbreak, with the usa and brazil accounting for 48.32% of the total cases. other notable affected countries include spain, france, colombia, the uk, germany, peru, mexico, and canada. in africa, nigeria has the highest mpox cases with 634 cases. ecology, host range, tissue and cell tropism despite the name, monkeypox, monkeys are not the genuine reservoir of mpxv. several animals can naturally or experimentally be infected with mpxv, but the natural host reservoir remains elusive. while specific host-cell receptors are responsible for cell tropism, the specificity of mpxv is yet to be determined. factors like the monkeypox inhibitor of complement enzymes and complement control protein can influence the viral cellular and tissue tropism. nonetheless, a wide spectrum of tissue and host tropism is expected, which may explain the possibility of mpxv establishing animal reservoirs in non-endemic regions. organs such as ovaries, kidneys, heart, brain, pancreas, liver, and lung have been identified as some of the tissue tropism for mpxv. however, specific virus ligands remain unidentified. the inability to identify specific virus ligands and cognate host receptors for mpxv tropism suggests that the virus uses many alternative ligands to successfully invade host cells or the host receptors have functional redundancy to the virus ligand. spillover to humans might arise from the disruptions of the natural habitats of wild animals. this could occur via various routes, including aerosol, direct contact, and fomite transmission. it is believed that the mpxv outbreaks in africa prior to 2022 occurred as a result of a spillover from animals to humans. thus, there is a likelihood of mpxv being sustained in the spillover due to the wide geographical coverage of the mpxv hosts. genomics, phylogenomics, phylodynamics, and evolution mpxv genome and gene content mpxv has a long and complex genome of 196 kbp - 211 kbp with a conserved central region and variable inverted terminal repeats. within mpxv clades, clade i isolates have more uniform genome length than clade ii isolates. the length of mxpv itr varies between 6.5 kbp to 17.5 kbp. our genomic comparison of mpxv clades indicated similar gene synteny, but slight differences in the gene content among the clades due to some genes that are missing or truncated in either one or two clades. the results are consistent with a previous study which indicates that four genes are missing and three genes are truncated in clade ii. furthermore, the homologue of vacv-cop e5r is only absent in clade i and three genes are truncated. another major difference is the gene content of their left terminal in which clade iia contains four genes that are absent in clade i and iib. however, these four genes are present on the right terminal of all clades. furthermore, clade i and iib have thed2l gene. within clade iib, gene content of the lineage a and b.1 are similar. phylogenomics and phylodynamics our bayesian phylogenetic analysis of 62 non-recombinant conserved genes from 197 mpxv isolates resolved mpxv into three monophyletic clades, namely clade i, clade iia and clade iib consisting majorly of human mpxv isolated between 2017-2022. clade iib was further divided into lineages: a, a.1, a.2, a.3, and b.1 as assigned by the gisaid. mpxv tree topology reported here is similar to that of the trees reported previously. isidro et al. reported that the transition from a.1/a.1.1 to b.1 is characterized by a long, divergent branch which suggests accelerated microevolution. the findings of this current study agree with the suggestion. lineage a corresponds to the 2017–2019 outbreak, although it contains strains isolated after this time frame and this observation has been reported by others. a recent study showed that new nigerian hmpxv genomes isolated in 2019-2020 were identified as belonging to the lineage a. lineage b.1 contains most hmpxv genomes from 2022. it is poorly resolved, and its sub-lineages cannot be unequivocally assigned. the low clade supports are probably due to very low genetic variability among isolates. polytomy within lineage b.1 could be an indication of uncertainty in the relatedness of isolates or the belief that those isolates evolved independently from a single origin, although recombination cannot be excluded. furthermore, molecular dating analysis was carried out on the 62 non-recombinant conserved genes of 197 mpxv isolates to estimate the evolutionary rate and the time of the most recent ancestor. tempest analysis showed temporal signal in the dataset. maximum clade credibility tree demonstrated that mpxv emerged at 1730, 1663 – 1790) with a mean evolutionary rate estimated to be 5.68 × 10−6, with 95% hpd of 4.53 × 10−6 − 6.86 × 10−6 subs/site/year. a recent publication estimated the substitution rate to be 5 x 10-6 which is in agreement with our result, but previous estimations of the substitution rates of clades i and iia were smaller. clades i, iia, and iib were estimated to have emerged in 1956, 1928, and 1938, respectively which is earlier by 33, 47, and 97 years as estimated by forni et al.. lineage a and b.1 were estimated to have a tmrca of 1998 and 2016, respectively. our dating analysis put the emergence of the b.1 lineage six years earlier than that estimated by luna et al. and nextclade. this discrepancy may be explained by molecular dating methods used. we hypothesize that the emergence of lineage a about 1998 allowed enough time for lineage a evolution and that may explain the long divergent branch length from lineage a to b.1. similarly, the emergence of lineage b.1 in 2016 in tandem with clustering of some 2022 isolates within the lineage a support cryptic transmission of the b.1 viruses prior to the current 2022 outbreak in multiple non-endemic countries. a recent molecular clock analysis based on accumulation of apobec3 -type mutations inferred that mpxv with apobec3 editing has been in circulation since at least 2016, and this is in agreement with our molecular dating reported herein although their interpretation differs from ours. while we infer that b.1 lineage emerged in 2016, o`toole et al. concluded that apobec3-type mutations, a predictor of human-to-human transmission emerged in 2016. the close phylogenetic relationship between a.1 isolates from nigeria with b.1 suggests a single origin for lineage b.1. mutational analysis and recombination our mutational analysis revealed that lineage b.1 has 66-86 nucleotide substitutions and 28-39 amino acid substitutions compared to reference genome nc_063383.1, mpxv from 2018. consensus substitutions predominantly affect genes responsible for host/immune modulation and viral replication/transcription. b21r codes for a t cell suppressor; our analysis demonstrated that this open reading frame contained three consensus amino acid substitutions. a18r contained three substitutions. excluding g8r with two substitutions, all the other affected orfs contained one consensus amino acid substitution each. the impact of these substitutions on the pathogenicity, transmissibility, immune evasion, and host specificity of mpxv remains unknown. the e353k substitution within f13l affects the target for the antiviral agent, tecovirimat; however, functional studies have not revealed any effect on the efficacy of the drug. wang et al. also reported three mutations in opg210 protein in mpxv 2022 outbreak strains. additionally, they showed that this protein together with other nine proteins have more mutations compared to the other mpxv proteins. in contrast to our study, previous mutational studies have reported fewer consensus substitutions. they reported 46 shared mutations in mpxv genomes from 2022 outbreak compared with nc_063383. however the number of mutations identified here and in other studies is higher than one would expect for mpxv, based on the low substitution rate of opxv. the accelerated evolution of mpxv has been attributed to the human apobec3. since most mutations identified here and elsewhere were ga>aa and tc>tt mutations, which are compatible with apobec3 activity. apobec3 is a cytidine deaminase known to play important functions in innate anti-viral immunity. evidence for the accumulation of apobec3 enriched substitutions in mpxv isolates has been reported since 2017, which corresponds to the detection of lineage a. ever since, every year, there has been an increase in apobec3-like mutations in mpxv. this mutational pattern has become more pronounced as suggested from more recent isolates,. the recent pattern of upsurge of apobec3 derived mutations may be an indication of a change in virus-host interaction such as sustained human-human transmission or a new route of infection. gigante et al. suggested the possibility of recombination in mpxv following observation of three sequences that showed a chimeric pattern in their genomes, although assembly errors could be a plausible explanation. recently, tandem repeats and linkage disequilibrium analysis provided evidence of natural recombination in lineage b.1. infection biology and pathophysiology virus morphogenesis, pathogenesis and pathophysiology poxvirus mature particles are ovoid or brick-shaped with surface tubules and have a characteristic dumbbell-shaped nucleoprotein core containing the viral genome. mpxv virions are ~200 nm in diameter and ~300 nm in length. like other opxvs, mpxv forms three distinct infectious virus particles: intracellular mature virus, cell associated enveloped virus and extracellular enveloped virus although cev and eev are morphologically and structurally indistinguishable. morphogenesis and transmission of imv, cev, and eev are described in
figure 4a. observations of cynomolgus monkeys infected with mpxv gave the first indications of the pathogenic role of this virus with intramuscular injection of the virus leading to an intense inflammatory immune response. the pathogenesis of mpxv has also been studied in other animals, including rabbits, rodents and prairie dogs. studies in monkeys, mice, and prairie dogs demonstrated that clade i viruses are more virulent than clade ii strains, which reflects the situation in humans. except for disease severity, the clinical features of the two clades are similar. mpxv infection has an incubation period of 5–21 days and the most common symptoms for the 2022 human mpox outbreak in non-endemic regions based on 48,622 patients were skin lesions, fever, lymphadenopathy, fatigue/asthenia, myalgia, and headache. regarding skin lesions, anogenital lesions were most frequent, followed by lesions on the trunk/torso, face/head, and extremities. this is in contrast with previous human mpox outbreaks from 1980-2022 where skin lesions were most common on the face and extremities. lymphadenopathy, which typically occurs 1-2 days before rash, is a distinct feature of mpxv which is used to distinguish it from smallpox and chickenpox. the morphological progression of the rash is macular, popular, vesicular, and pustular lesions. the crust formed by pustules desquamate after 1-2 weeks. in the current outbreak, inguinal lymphadenopathy was more frequent than cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy, whereas in previous outbreaks in endemic countries submandibular, cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy were more frequent. the differences in clinical symptoms between human mpox infections before 2022 and the current outbreak are probably the result of different virus strain and patient group. in men having sex with men, atypical clinical symptoms such as genital lesions and anal ulcers were observed. mpxv can enter the host via the oral/respiratory tract, infecting the oral and respiratory tract mucosae, with the upper, middle and lower airway epithelium as main targets for primary infection. mpxv can directly infect damaged skin, and replicate in keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. from the initial infection sites, virus can spread to draining lymph nodes, where the virus can replicate. mpxv can subsequently reach the tonsils, the spleen, and the liver. replication in these organs results in a second viraemia wave, enabling the virus to access distant organs such as the lung, kidneys, intestines, and skin and causing recognizable clinical manifestation. comparison of the clade i and ii strains has provided an indication which viral gene products may be responsible for their difference in virulence. the d14l gene which encodes valosin-containing protein -mpxv, also known as ccp or mopice, is the orthologue of vacv secreted complement c3b/c4b-binding protein vacv-cop c3l. this protein is known to inhibit the complement and to contribute to virulence. compared to the vacv protein, vcp-mpxv/mopice is truncated due to a single nucleotide deletion in the d14l gene leading to a stop codon. the gene is absent from clade ii strains due to ~10 kbp deletion. deletion of the c3l gene caused vacv attenuation in infected animal models. studies with clade i mpxv with deleted d14l showed that intranasal infection of prairie dogs resulted in decreased morbidity and mortality. however, ablation of d14l did not significantly affect virus replication compared to animals infected with control clade i virus. on the other hand, clade ii virus with inserted d14l gene did not have virulence compared to clade i virus and no apparent effect on disease-associated mortality compared to control clade ii virus was observed. so, other factors besides vcp-mpxv/mopice are necessary to explain the difference in virulence between clade i and ii mpxv. other candidate virulence genes include br-203, br-209, and the opxv major histocompatibility complex class i–like protein orthologue. br-203 protein is an orthologue to the myxoma virus m-t4, which plays a role in avoiding apoptosis of infected lymphocytes, hence promoting viral spread within the host. myxoma virus expressing c-terminal truncated m-t4 caused increased inflammatory response compared to rabbits infected with wildtype virus, whereas challenging with virus lacking m-t4 resulted in disease attenuation. thus, br-203 may have a dual function in protecting infected lymphocytes from apoptosis and in modulating the inflammatory response to virus infection. the br-209 gene encodes a 326 aa interleukin-1β binding protein, which prevents il-1β from interacting with the il-1 receptor. mice intranasally infected with vacv lacking il-1β binding protein developed a more severe illness than wildtype virus. perturbing the il-1 signaling pathway dampens the innate and acquired immunity, explaining the virulent action of the il-1β binding protein. interestingly, the br-209 gene of clade i strains has two orfs that can encode a putative n-terminal protein fragment of 210 aa and a c-terminal protein fragment of 126 aa, whereas the clade ii strains encode a putative n-terminal 163 aa polypeptide and a c-terminal 132 aa fragment. it is unknown if any of the fragments function in a way similar to the full-length protein, nor if the differences in the length of the n-terminal fragments of clade i versus clade ii strains of mpxv contribute to the differences in virulence. the omcp gene from clade i strains isolated in the drc carries a 628 bp deletion, which removes the 5’region of the n3r gene and the n2r gene. ompc functions as soluble natural killer group 2, member d receptor ligand, possibly representing a strategy to avoid nk-cell-mediated killing. based on the clinical metadata, it was suggested that the deletion is associated with increased human-to-human transmission and pathogenicity compared to clade iia and clade iib isolates. the clade i strain also contains truncated orthologues of vacv-cop e3l and vacv-cop k3l, two proteins that function in interferon resistance. clade i and clade ii genomes differ also in vacv-coph5r, vacv-cop a9l, vacv-cop a50r ), and vacv-cop a36r ). the exact mechanisms by which these proteins may also contribute to differences in pathogenicity between clade i and ii strains remains elusive. signal transduction and pathways manipulation of signaling pathways promotes viral replication and determines disease outcomes, mainly by targeting cell growth and immune responses. mpxv infection suppresses expression of host genes whose products are implicated in regulation of histone expression, cytoskeletal rearrangements, cell cycle progression, ifn-associated genes, and signaling pathways such as the nuclear factor kappa b, the mitogen-activated protein kinase, and metabolic pathways. the nfκb pathway plays pivotal roles in inflammation and immunity. nfκb is typically found as a cytosolic trimer of p65/p50 and the inhibitor protein iκb. phosphorylation of iκb by the trimer ikkα/ikkβ/ikkγ results in the release and activation of p65/p50, which translocate to the nucleus and act as a transcription factor. ankyrin proteins from opxvs can inhibit the nfκb pathway by interfering with different components of this pathway. mpxv genome encodes the ankyrin-like proteins j3l, d1l, d7l, d9l, o1l, c1l, b5r, b17r, n4r, and j1r, but their exact function remains to be determined. in addition, the mpxv bcl2-like proteins a47r, b13r, c6r, and p1l can prevent activation of the nfκb pathway. the mpxv b1r gene encodes the vacv kelch-like protein a55, which inhibits the nfκb pathway and stimulates cd8+ t cell proliferation. however, it remains to be determined whether b1r exerts a similar function. the janus kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway mediates cellular responses to cytokines and growth factors. h1l inactivates stat1, and c6r blocks stat2. whether the mpxv h1l and d11l orthologues act similarly has not been investigated. the vacv epidermal growth factor homologue vgf usurps the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway to provoke cell proliferation and to stimulate efficient virus spread and pathogenesis. the d3r gene encodes an egf homologue that might activate the egfr pathway and enhance viral dissemination. vacv-cop f11l also promotes viral spreading by inhibiting the rhoa signaling pathway. it is not known whether the mpxv orthologue c17l possesses the same function. circumventing apoptosis is used by viruses to achieve productive replication. vacv f1l and n1l proteins can prevent apoptosis by inhibiting pro-apoptotic proteins bak, bid, bad, and bax. it is unknown whether the mpxv c7l and p1l isologues have similar functions. other mpxv genes that prevent apoptosis include b12r, b19r, d5r, and f3l. b12 is a serine protease and its vacv orthologue b13r has been shown to be a caspase inhibitor. signal transduction is often mediated through a cascade of phosphorylation events. kindrachuk et al. compared the phosphorylation pattern of host cell proteins after clade i or clade ii mpxv infection. they found that clade i mpxv infection down-regulated pathways related to cell proliferation and apoptosis as compared with clade ii mpxv. differences in mpxv-induced posttranslational modification may explain the differences in virulence between mpxv clades. host immune response and virus immune decoy mechanisms host immune response human infection with mpxv is associated with increased levels of ils, c-c motif chemokine ligand 2 and ccl5, and a significant decrease in tumor necrosis factor alpha, ifn-γ, and il-2 and il-12. mpxv infection provokes igm and igg antibodies, long-term persistence of residual igg-memory b cells, and a rapid expansion of activated effector cd4+ and cd8+ t cells followed by a decrease over time. mpxv also interferes with adaptive immune responses of antiviral cd8 + and cd4 + t cell responses via inhibiting t cell receptor-mediated t cell activation. evasion host immune defense because of the high homology between the mpxv genes and the corresponding opxv orthologues, it is assumed and, in some cases, demonstrated that mpxv applies similar strategies to evade the host immune defense system. the toll-like receptor family functions as pattern recognition receptors, which recognize damage-associated molecular patterns such as viral dsrna. binding of viral dsrna to specific tlr members triggers the expression of proinflammatory molecules involved in host anti-viral responses and subsequent activation of the adaptive immune defense system. the vavc a46 protein inhibits the tlr4 signaling pathway. however, it is unknown whether the mpxv orthologue a47 has the same property, but the a47 protein has structural similarities to vacv protein a52r, which can inhibit the tlr3 and tlr4 signaling pathways, underscoring a role for mpxv a47 in interfering with tlr signaling. mpxv produces low levels of dsrna intermediates, but whether these are recognized by tlr3 has not been investigated, although transcriptome analysis of mpxv-infected cells revealed repression of tlr3 target genes. dsrna can also activate kinase r, which mediates phosphorylation of eif2α, resulting in the inhibition of viral and cellular mrna translation. vacv e3 and k3 are inhibitors of pkr, allowing vacv to evade an antiviral response. the n-terminal domain of vacv e3 protein is absolutely required for the interaction with dsrna. mpxv f3 protein is the vacv e3 protein homologue with a 37 aa truncation at the amino terminus, suggesting that mpxv f3 does not bind dsrna. however, mpxv can inhibit host immune responses, although a recombinant vacv expressing the mpxv f3l gene did not inhibit host pkr activation, suggesting that mpxv has evolved to encode for yet undiscovered proteins that compensate for the missing n-terminal amino acids of f3 in limiting host antiviral activities. as previously mentioned, mpxv ccp is completely absent in clade ii isolates, whereas the clade i strains are predicted to express ccp, albeit with a truncated fourth short consensus repeat. loss of expression of ccp/mopice limited the adaptive immune response against mpxv infection in rhesus macaques. ifns are main effectors of the innate immune response and can inhibit virus replication. the mpxv b16 protein is a secreted type i ifn inhibitor and suppresses the antiviral type i ifn-induced signaling pathway. vacv k7 abrogates ifn signaling by destabilizing ifn-regulated factor 3 and inhibits nfκb activation, whereas vacv h1 can block ifn signaling. whether the mpxv d9 and h1 orthologues have the same function remains to be proven, but both proteins are predicted to interact with several cellular proteins of the immune system. vacv e3 perturbs ifn signaling by binding host z-dna binding protein 1. the mpxv e3 orthologue perturbs the ifn pathway, but whether in a zbp1-dependent manner needs to be established. the dna-sensing receptor pathway cgas/sting can activate the ifn and nfκb pathways. the vacv b16 and b8 proteins block ifn signaling by operating as soluble ifn-α and ifn-γ receptors, respectively. the mpxv orf b16r and b9r encode functional homologues. opxvs encode poxins that degrade 2′,3′ cgamp and thereby inhibit cgas/sting signaling. poxin is conserved in mpxv where it is fused to an additional c-terminal domain previously noted to have homology with human schlafen proteins, hence mpxv may evade the immune system by targeting the cgas/sting pathway. mpxv can dodge the immune system by targeting the antiviral cytokine tnfα and other immunomodulating molecules. the mpxv-encoded cytokine response-modifying protein b functions as a decoy receptor for tnfα. the c-terminal domain of vacv crmb can bind ccl28, ccl25, cxc motif chemokine ligand 12, cxcl13 and cxcl14. it is unknown whether mpxv crmb interacts with these chemokines, but the amino acid sequence of the corresponding domain in mpxv crmb differs significantly. natural killer cells and cytotoxic t cells play a crucial role in eliminating viral infections. although the number of nk cells expand significantly in peripheral blood and lymph nodes in mpxv-infected rhesus macaques, their migrating capacity was reduced, and several functions such as expression of chemokine receptors and secretion of ifnγ and tnfα were impaired. the importance of nk cells in controlling mpxv viral load was demonstrated in the highly vulnerable to opxv infection cast/eij mouse strain owing to low numbers of nk cells. il-15 treatment, known to increase the numbers of ifnγ-secreting nk cells and cd8+ t cells, protected cast/eij mice from lethal mpxv infection even when both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells were depleted. this implies that the expanded nk cells were responsible for the protective effect. mpxv protein b10 avoids detection of virus-infected cells by ctl by impairing peptide loading and mhc-i trafficking within the endoplasmic reticulum. however, nk cells continually screen cells via nkg2d for the absence of mhc-i, thereby ensuring that the mhc system is not compromised. mpxv-infected cells with downregulated mhc-i expression overcomes detection by nk cells by secreting the ocmp protein that binds nkg2d and suppress the typical nkg2d-dependent nk cell lysis of cells that do not express mhc-i. il-18, an ifnγ-inducing factor, stimulates the synthesis of various cytokines and chemokines, regulates th1 and th2 cell responses, and activates nk and ctl. opxvs block il-18 activities by producing an il-18 binding protein. the mpxv d6l gene encodes such il-18 binding protein. the mpxv j3r and a41l genes encode chemokine binding proteins, which are assumed to destroy the chemokine concentration gradient resulting in decreased neutrophil migration in tissues infected with mpxv and thus reducing viral virulence and inflammatory response. the complement system, which forms an essential part of the innate immune system is activated early in mpxv infection in mice, and is crucial for viral control. mpxv mopice which from studies with varv and vacv mopice was found to inhibit activation of the complement pathway. mopice modulates the antiviral immune response as observed by enhanced viral replication in vivo and dampened adaptive immune response in rhesus macaques infected with mpxv lacking mopice expression. because of the absence of the d14l gene in the clade ii, the virus and virus-infected cells would be predicted to be susceptible to the host complement attack. however, the expression of mopice in clade ii did not increase its virulence, demonstrating that mopice is not the sole determinant of differences in viral virulence between the two clades. less is known how mpxv may interfere with the adaptive immune system. mpxv interferes with adaptive immune responses of antiviral cd8 + and cd4 + t cell responses via inhibiting t cell receptor-mediated t cell activation.vacv a35 blocks immune priming of t lymphocytes by interfering with mhc class ii-restricted antigen presentation. moreover, infection studies in cells with mpxv lacking the a35r gene demonstrated that a35 inhibits production of cytokines and chemokines. mpxv a35 analogue, a37, might suppress presentation of viral antigens to immune cells and help the virus to evade the host immune defense system. however, mpxv does not seem to interfere with mhc expression or intracellular transport of mhc molecules. epidemiology demographic and epidemiological characteristics surveillance data on mpox in endemic countries during different periods between 1970-2015 showed that 71%-83% of the disease occurred in children and 51%-67% in males. in contrast, the median age for the 2017-2018 outbreak in nigeria was 29 years, with males accounting for 64% of the cases. however, for the 2022 multi-country outbreak, males accounted for 96.8% of the cases, and the median age was 34 years. in the african region, children accounted for 23.08% of mpox cases compared to <1% in europe and the americas. notably, the male-to-female ratio in africa is also markedly lower than in other regions. case fatality rate before the 2022 outbreak, the overall pooled estimated case fatality rate was 8.7% and varied by the clade of the virus. the pooled cfr for clade ii was 3.6% and 10.6% for clade i. the 2022 outbreak has an estimated cfr of 0.08%. the low cfr in the current outbreak may be related to several factors, including the fact that the clade ii has a cfr of <1%, active surveillance, early diagnosis, and treatment. secondary attack rate over the past five decades, the secondary attack rate for mpox has been stable and ranges from 0% to 10.2%. higher estimates were reported in the 2013 outbreak in the drc and nigeria. however, it is imperative to note that it is unclear how the high estimates were obtained and thus may likely be overestimated. virus reproduction number reproduction number is the number of secondary cases anticipated to develop from a single primary case in a naive population. while historical data on r0 is limited, published evidence from drc’s active surveillance between 1980 and 1984 estimated r0 to be 0.8, implying that transmission is ineffective as a human-to-human epidemic is likely to die out. however, early estimations of the r0 in the 2022 outbreak in non-endemic countries showed a high variability ranging from 1.54 to 3.62, with a median of 2.44. this suggests sustained human-to-human transmission, possibly due to several contributing factors, including different social and/or sexual behaviors, different mpxv variants, population density or other unknown causes. while the early estimations indicated sustained transmission, the outbreak has slowed down with case reductions. this could be due to behavior change, infection induced immunity, and vaccinations. risk factors and co-morbidities transmission of mpxv can occur from animal-to-human and from human-to-human. zoonotic transmission usually happens through contact with an infected animal’s bodily fluid or through a bite or scratch. exposure to animal reservoirs, especially in regions with deforestation enhancing animal-human contact, and uncooked meat products are major risk factors for zoonotic transmission. during the 2003 usa outbreak, exposure was classified as “non-invasive” or “complex”. patients with complex exposures were more likely to develop systemic illness compared to those with non-invasive exposure. dewitt et al. predicted the mpxv mode of transmission in most 2022 studies to be caused by inter-human transmission. large respiratory droplets, bodily fluids, contaminated fomites, and viral shedding through feces are also considered risk factors for viral transmission. airborne transmission of mpxv between animals in experimental settings has also been reported and mpxv was detected in upper respiratory samples, suggesting that interhuman transmission of mpxv via the airborne route may be possible. however, epidemiological observations do not support airborne transmission as the primary route of transmission. the virus can also cross the placenta, suggesting vertical transmission. at least 12 pregnant women have been infected during the 2022 outbreak, but vertical transmission was not observed in any case. mpxv has also been detected in human semen, and in archival testes tissue of crab-eating macaque, suggesting potential sexual transmission of the virus. recent outbreak suggests that msm subpopulation may also be at an increased risk. in addition, waning immunity against smallpox has been considered another potential risk factor for the disease. evidence from early outbreaks in the 1980s showed that previous smallpox vaccination provided 85% protection against mpox. most cases reported were among those born after vaccination ceased in 1980, and herd immunity has significantly decreased. evidence from the literature suggests that those who are immunocompromised due to hiv and other underlying conditions are at increased risk of severe mpox disease, 2022b). a high proportion of patients with mpox in the 2022 outbreak had concurrent hiv infection and sexually transmitted infections. mpox patients with hiv infection were more likely to be hospitalized than those without hiv infection. however, the evidence on the reason for hospitalization is limited, and it is unknown if it reflects a more severe mpox illness. furthermore, co-infection with other conditions with rashes, such as a varicella-zoster virus, can occur. this herpesvirus causes chickenpox and shingles and is frequently misdiagnosed as mpox in regions where both diseases are endemic. chickenpox is exclusive to humans and more common in younger age groups, and co-infection with mpox has been reported more commonly among children. diagnosis, screening, prevention, and treatment diagnosis and case definitions electron microscopy, immunohistochemical detection of mpxv proteins, and detectable levels of anti-opxv igm antibody during the period of 4 to 56 days after rash onset can be used to diagnose mpxv infection, but all methods are not specific, 2022a). according to the centers for disease control and prevention, 2022a), mpox cases should be confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction or next-generation sequencing and isolation of mpxv in culture from a clinical specimen. the f3l, e9l, b6r and j2r genes are all target of qpcr in mpxv diagnosis. the suspected mpox cases are characterized by fulfilling one of the epidemiological criteria, as outlined by cdc, 2022a). surveillance and contact tracing one of the crucial ways of controlling the spread of mpox is contact tracing. individuals exposed to mpxv should be monitored for 21 days checking mpox symptoms, and those with suspected or confirmed mpox cases should be isolated to avoid infecting others. velavan et al. predicted the mpox outbreak would not last provided that cases are well isolated through the contact tracing. although much attention is given to human-human contact tracing, great efforts need to be put into animal-animal and animal-human contact tracing especially due to non-specificity of reservoir hosts for mpxv. surveillance cannot be undermined in curtailing mpox as surveillance would provide more insight into the epidemiology of the disease. in nigeria, the outbreak response management and analysis system for mpox surveillance across portions of 8 states was implemented in november 2017 for the mpox outbreak. the use of the system increased the quantity of epidemiological data collected and the communication of aggregate case data. vaccine although there is no specific vaccine for mpxv, the smallpox vaccines have been reported to give 85% cross-immunity against mpxv due to shared antigenic features. acam2000™ is a replication-competent vaccinia virus vaccine licensed by food and drug administration in august 2007 for smallpox prevention, and it is derived from a single clonal viral isolate from dryvax which is a first-generation smallpox vaccine. as a second-generation attenuated vaccinia virus vaccine, acam2000™ has been recommended as mpxv post-exposure prophylaxis. although high level of protection against mpox in animal models has been recorded, the safety of acam2000™ in humans is still of great concern as cardiac complications, and extremely painful and uncomfortable cutaneous reaction at the injection site have been associated with the vaccine. therefore, the vaccine is no longer licensed by european union. jynneos was approved by fda in september 2019 for prevention of smallpox and mpox in adults aged >18years. jynneos is the brand name of modified vaccinia virus ankara bavarian nordic vaccine, a non-replicating third-generation attenuated vaccine. jynneos is considered safer than acam2000™. the advisory committee on immunization practices has recommended jynneos as an alternative to acam2000™. nonetheless, both vaccines have been recommended for mpxv high-risk groups. lc16m8 is another potential vaccine for mpxv which is obtained by subjecting vacv lister to 36 serial passages at low temperature in primary rabbit kidney cells. as a third-generation attenuated vaccine, lc16m8 has been shown to be protective against mpxv in animal models with lower neurotoxicity. the frameshift mutation in lc16m8’s major extracellular enveloped virion antigen contributes to the vaccine replication competence and low virulence. presently, lc16m8 is only licensed in japan. antivirals although there are no specific antivirals for mpox, some antivirals have been explored. tecovirimat, 4-trifluoromethylphenol derivative, was approved by fda in 2018 and approved by european medicines agency in january 2022 for treatment of smallpox and cowpox. tecovirimat inhibits vp37 protein of vacv by targeting the viral f13l gene and the cpxv homolog v016 gene. vp37, a highly conserved protein in opxv genus, is required for viral maturation and release from the infected cell. inhibition of vp37 prevents viral spread within an infected animal models. goyal etal. recommended tecovirimat to be administered as first line of mpox treatment in pregnant and breastfeeding patients. a tecovirimat analogue has been highlighted as a promising antivirals against opxv infections. cidofovir prodrug is an acyclic nucleoside phosphate that was approved by fda in 1996 for the treatment of retinitis in aids patients. the efficacy of cdv has been identified during the in vitro studies in mpxv-infected animals, but the clinical data of cdv efficacy against mpox in human are not available. brincidofovir, a cdv derivative, was approved for smallpox treatment in 2021 by fda, and it has lesser toxic effects than cdv. evaluation of cmx001 efficacy and safety in human mpox through the clinical trials is needed. biosafety, biosecurity and bioethics recombination with vaccinia virus and other opxv due to inadequate genome surveillance data particularly in endemic regions, little information about mpxv recombination is available. however, there are some evidences of recombination between coinfecting or superinfecting opxvs both in a laboratory setting and in nature. mpxv circulating in non-endemic regions where other opxvs are endemic, for instance, cpxv in europe and vacv-like in south america, and vaccination against mpox with jynneous or acam 2000 are scenarios for coinfection and superinfection between different species of opxv. thus, there remains a potential risk of recombination between mpxv and other opxvs that may result in mpxvs with mosaic genomes and altered biological characteristics. dual use and bioterrorism although there is insufficient evidence of mpxv being used for bioterrorism at the moment, many scientists have expressed concerns over its potential use for bioterrorism because there is a report that there was an attempt by the former soviet union to use mpxv as a bioweapon. the possibility of mpxv as a potential bioweapon due to its global reemergence and its clinical similarities with varv has placed the virus on the global public health agenda. for example, the usa has made preparation for the possibility of smallpox virus as a potential bioterror biological by storing smallpox vaccines and antivirals after the 9/11 attack. smallpox virus is in category a of the cdc list of bioterrorism agents. the risk of bioterrorism is heightened knowing that mpxv genomes can be synthesized from publicly available sequence data and life viruses can be re-constituted. this has already been demonstrated with horsepox virus, which shares the same genus as mpxv. hence, a strict dual-use policy must be agreed upon and implemented in all laboratories across the globe. stigmatization and vaccine inequity sexual orientation and racial are two stigmas associated with mpxv. the persistent narrative of the media alongside many scientists linking the mpox 2022 outbreak to africa/west africa/nigeria is worrisome. despite the mpox 2022 outbreak, which occurred outside africa, the nomenclature and the geographical labels of mpxv strains still reference west african, even though the origin of this outbreak is still unresolved. furthermore, high mpox cases were reported among msm. this narrative portrays these men contracting mpxv because they engaged in sexual intercourse with fellow men, meanwhile the spread of the virus can occur regardless the sex. vaccine inequality affects lower- and middle-income countries. an unknown number of mpox cases in lmics are not captured due to a shortage of resources like limited testing and surveillance capacity. as highlighted by malta et al., the mpxv vaccines are presently accessible only in high-income countries. conclusion mpxv has emerged and re-emerged for over five decades and yet not much is known about its virological profile and the characteristics of the disease it causes. in particular, the reservoir host of mpxv remains unknown, the viral, host and environmental factors that modulate the virus maintenance in the wild, animal-to-animal transmission, zoonotic transmission and reverse spillover are still a mystery. neither are we closer to reliable prognostication of virus emergence and accurate modelling of the disease outcomes. current and future studies should prioritize understanding the molecular basis of mpxv infection to develop effective drugs and vaccines against mpox as well as functional mutational studies that will shed insight into the dynamics of mpxv transmission across hosts. to improve tracking of mpxv, laboratories particularly in resource-poor countries should be equipped with genome-based surveillance capacity and capability. lastly, mpxv and mpox affect human, animal, and ecosystem health. thus, a one health strategy is indispensable to the prevention and treatment of current and future outbreaks. author contributions mo: conceptualization, data curation, investigation, methodology, supervision, writing – original draft, writing – review & editing. ea: formal

mpox virus: virology, molecular epidemiology, and global public health challenges abstract monkeypox, a zoonotic disease caused by the mpox virus, has re-emerged as a significant global health concern, particularly since the 2022 outbreaks in non-endemic countries. mpxv shares close virological and genetic similarities with other orthopoxviruses, notably variola virus. the current circulating strains, primarily of clade iib, exhibit enhanced human-to-human transmissibility. this review synthesizes recent advances in mpxv virology, pathogenesis, molecular evolution, clinical features, and diagnostic techniques. in addition, we highlight the mounting public health challenges, including vaccine inequity, immunity gaps in the post-smallpox era, surveillance limitations, healthcare system vulnerabilities, and stigma-related barriers to disease reporting and control. addressing these multifaceted issues requires a globally coordinated response integrating equitable vaccine access, strengthened surveillance, stigma-free health education, and harmonized outbreak response strategies. a comprehensive understanding of these factors is critical to preventing future large-scale outbreaks and mitigating the global health burden posed by mpxv. virological characteristics of mpxv mpxv belongs to the orthopoxvirus genus within the poxviridae family. it is an enveloped linear double-stranded dna virus, approximately 200–250 nm in size, appearing as oval or brick-shaped particles under electron microscopy, surrounded by a lipoprotein membrane. the virus structure is composed of three main parts: the core, which contains the viral genome; the lateral bodies located on either side of the core; and the outer protein envelope. although mpxv is a dna virus, it primarily replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells, encoding proteins that promote viral genome replication and gene expression. during its replication cycle, mpxv produces four distinct types of viral particles: intracellular mature virus, intracellular enveloped virus, cell-associated enveloped virus, and extracellular enveloped virus. among these, imv and eev are the primary infectious forms. the viral particles enter host cells through binding and fusion with the host cell membrane, after which they release pre-packaged viral proteins and enzymes into the cytoplasm, suppressing the host immune defense system and initiating early viral gene expression. the virus then undergoes dna replication, transcription, and translation to complete its life cycle. mature imv can be released externally through cell lysis or by forming eev via fusion with the golgi apparatus and cytoplasmic membrane. eev has two main release pathways: transported along microtubules to the cell membrane, followed by exocytosis; directly released into the external environment through interactions with actin. these distinct release mechanisms enable mpxv to efficiently spread within the host and accelerate its transmission in human populations. mpxv, like variola virus, cowpox viruses, and vaccinia virus, belongs to the orthopoxvirus genus and is one of the largest dna viruses found in mammals. phylogenetic analyses suggest that mpxv originated approximately 600 years ago in west africa. genetic studies show that these four poxviruses share a common ancestor and have highly similar dna sequences. immunologically, these viruses exhibit cross-antigenicity, meaning infection with one of these viruses can provide some degree of protection against the other three. in their study on orthopoxviruses, shchelkunov et al. compared the amino acid sequences of mpxv and varv, finding that the central genomic region of the two viruses has an amino acid sequence similarity of up to 96%, while the terminal regions show 83.5–93.6% amino acid similarity, indicating a close evolutionary relationship between mpxv and varv. additionally, research on the vaccinia virus tian tan strain demonstrated that vacv and mpxv are structurally highly similar, with 90% homology in their dna sequences, and they maintain this high degree of conservation during viral replication. notably, vacv proteins a27l, l1r, d8l, b5r, and a33r show significant homology with mpxv proteins a29l, l1r, e8l, b6r, and a35r, respectively. it is known that the varv was one of the earliest poxviruses to cause disease in humans and is one of the most lethal orthopoxviruses. in the 17th century, people developed the practice of “variolation” which involved grinding the scabs from smallpox patients into a powder and blowing it into the nostrils of uninfected individuals to provide immunity against smallpox. however, the mortality rate from this method was approximately 2%, presenting a significant risk. in the 18th century, to reduce the mortality associated with smallpox inoculation, dr. edward jenner used pus from cowpox lesions to inoculate a boy. although the boy developed mild symptoms, he fully recovered within a few weeks and did not contract smallpox when subsequently exposed to the virus. jenner’s cowpox vaccination successfully provided protection against smallpox. due to the cowpox vaccine being much safer than variolation, it quickly became the primary method for smallpox prevention. over time, it was discovered that the vacv vaccine not only provided better protection against smallpox but was also safer. as a result, vacv gradually replaced cpxv as the primary vehicle for the smallpox vaccine. the vacv-based smallpox vaccine significantly reduced the risks associated with vaccination and played a crucial role in the global eradication of smallpox. in 1980, the world health organization declared smallpox eradicated, after which china and other countries ceased smallpox vaccination. consequently, individuals born after 1980 lack vaccine-induced immunity and are more susceptible to mpxv. studies indicate that the vacv-based smallpox vaccine offers approximately 85% protection against mpxv. mpxv can be cultured in various cell lines, including rhesus monkey kidney cells and mouse liver cells. after inoculation with mpxv, its characteristic cytopathic effect and plaque formation can be observed, with plaque size being a distinguishing feature between mpxv and varv. mpxv exhibits strong survival capabilities in vitro, showing good tolerance to drying and low temperatures, but it is sensitive to high temperatures. on contaminated surfaces, mpxv can survive for several months in cold environments, but heating at 56°c for 30 min or 60°c for 10 min can inactivate the virus. mpxv is sensitive to common disinfectants and ultraviolet radiation, and it can be effectively inactivated by disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite, glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, and paraformaldehyde. pathogenic mechanisms of mpxv the mpxv genome is relatively large, approximately 197,000 base pairs, encoding 190 open reading frames and comprising over 200 genes. the mpxv genome is divided into three main sections: a central region encoding essential enzymes and structural proteins required for viral dna replication, transcription, and assembly; and two flanking regions containing inverted terminal repeats, which are primarily involved in virus-host interactions, immune evasion, and apoptosis signaling. current research on mpxv focuses on immunogenic proteins, such as a33r, a37r, b4r, and b5r proteins. the a33r protein facilitates the binding of the virus to host target cells. the a37r protein, homologous to the a35r protein in cpxv, may play a role in modulating the expression of mhc class ii molecules on the surface of host antigen-presenting cells. this function has been observed in cpxv’s a35r protein, and mpxv’s a37r protein is hypothesized to exhibit similar activity. the b4r and b5r proteins of mpxv have multiple functions, including inhibiting host cell proliferation, regulating hematopoiesis, modulating immune responses, and participating in host cell adhesion, signaling, and mrna transcription. understanding the structure and function of these viral proteins is crucial for addressing genetic changes that arise during periods of high viral transmission and for studying the virus-host immune system interactions. this knowledge also provides essential insights for developing new mpxv vaccines that can offer immunity against different viral strains and that are suitable for large-scale production. the pathogenic mechanisms of mpxv are similar to other orthopoxviruses, such as varv and vacv, in that mpxv is capable of infecting a variety of mammalian cells and is highly transmissible. mpxv’s initial infection targets primarily the oral cavity and respiratory tract, with an initial asymptomatic phase. the virus then migrates by infecting nearby immune cells and spreads from the primary infection site to adjacent draining lymph nodes. the infected immune cells may include monocytes, macrophages, b cells, and dendritic cells. there is debate regarding the early dissemination mechanisms of orthopoxviruses. for instance, in cpxv-infected mice, viral dissemination occurs through dendritic cells, transferring the virus from the pulmonary epithelium to the draining lymph nodes. in contrast, vacv infection of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells impairs their maturation and migration potential, allowing the virus to evade immune responses, suggesting that vacv may not rely on dendritic cells for viral spread. in 1969, wenner et al. studied the pathogenesis of mpxv by inoculating cynomolgus monkeys with the virus. they found that mpxv proliferated within cells at the injection site, accompanied by a local inflammatory response, including cell necrosis and vasculitis. mpxv was also detected in the lymph nodes and blood vessels, indicating that the virus spreads through lymphatic and blood pathways. mpxv reaches the lymphoid tissues in the neck and throat via draining lymph nodes, where it replicates, leading to viremia. subsequently, the virus further disseminates through the bloodstream to the liver and spleen. studies have shown that the liver and spleen are major targets for mpxv replication and dissemination. in these organs, viral infection exacerbates viremia, enabling further spread to the lungs, kidneys, and skin, which leads to various clinical symptoms in the host. in the early stages of mpxv infection, eev viral particles interact with the primary attachment receptors on the host cell membrane—glycosaminoglycans —via their surface proteins to enter the host cell. the specific host cell surface receptors and their associated proteins are not yet fully understood, but three mpxv-encoded proteins have been identified as being involved in viral entry. the first is the e8l protein, which can bind to chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans on the host cell surface, mediating the adsorption of imv to host cells. the second is the l1 protein, a viral envelope protein. studies on the pathogenesis of vacv have shown that the l1 protein is a key factor in the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane and is part of the entry/fusion complex. the l1 protein of mpxv shares high homology with that of vacv and likely plays a similar role in mpxv invasion of host cells, although this mechanism requires further investigation. the third is the h3l envelope protein, which has been found to play an important role in viral adsorption to host cells and the formation of imv in studies of varv. in addition, mpxv evades the host immune system through multiple mechanisms during human infection. the virus can escape detection by host pattern recognition receptors that sense rna, suppress ifn-mediated antiviral responses, control the apoptosis of infected cells, and limit the host’s inflammatory response. these mechanisms enhance viral replication capacity, creating a microenvironment conducive to viral replication, infection, and transmission. mpxv epidemiology since the eradication of smallpox in the 1980s, orthopoxviruses had largely faded from public attention. however, with the global outbreak of mpxv, this virus and other orthopoxviruses have returned to the spotlight. mpox, a zoonotic disease caused by mpxv, was first identified in 1958 in a laboratory in copenhagen, denmark, where a smallpox-like disease was observed in captive cynomolgus monkeys, giving rise to the name “monkeypox”. in 1970, mpxv was first isolated from a suspected smallpox patient in the democratic republic of the congo. between 1971 and 1978, 47 confirmed mpox cases were recorded, the majority of which were in central and west africa, with 38 cases in the drc. the remaining nine cases occurred in cameroon, the central african republic, gabon, côte d’ivoire, liberia, nigeria, and sierra leone. in may 2003, the first outbreak of mpxv outside of africa occurred in the united states, with 72 suspected cases reported, of which 47 were confirmed in the laboratory. an investigation by the centers for disease control and prevention linked this outbreak to prairie dogs imported from africa. from 2017 to 2018, nigeria experienced a large-scale mpox outbreak, with cases spreading to non-endemic countries. in 2019, singapore reported the first imported case of mpox in asia. before 2022, although a few non-endemic countries reported sporadic mpox cases, these cases were relatively infrequent compared to those occurring in africa during the same period. on may 16, 2022, the united kingdom reported its first imported case of mpox from nigeria. subsequently, other non-endemic countries, including spain, portugal, sweden, canada, and australia, also reported cases. by the end of may 2025, 133 countries and regions had reported a total of 150,069 mpox cases to the world health organization, including 328 deaths, confirming that the mpox outbreak is gradually becoming globalized. on july 23, 2022, the who declared the mpox outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern ” and assessed the risk level as moderate. from january 2022 to may 2025, europe and americas reported a total of 99,432 confirmed mpox cases, far exceeding the 42,829 cases reported in africa. the top five regions reporting mpox cases globally were the americas, africa, europe, the western pacific, and southeast asia. the first imported case of mpox in china was reported in taiwan in june 2022. in september of the same year, hong kong and chongqing also reported their first imported cases, followed by multiple provinces reporting mpox infections. this mpox outbreak spread rapidly and widely, with many cases lacking travel histories to central or west africa, becoming a significant public health concern and attracting heightened attention from various countries and the who. genomic sequencing studies indicate that mpxv has two main evolutionary branches: type i and type ii, both of which represent strains that initially infected humans. as mpxv continues to evolve, these branches have further diversified. the west african branch is divided into two sub-branches, iia and iib, with the iib sub-branch further subdivided into multiple lineages, including a.1, a.1.1, a.2, b.1, and b.1.1. the strains responsible for the nigerian outbreak in 2017–2018 were primarily of the a.2 lineage, while the imported strains reported in singapore, the uk, the usa, and israel from 2018 to 2021 were mainly of the a.1 lineage. the strains associated with the 2022 outbreak were predominantly of the b.1 lineage and its branches. research indicates that strains from branch i exhibit stronger virulence and transmissibility, with an average mortality rate of up to 10.6%. in contrast, strains from branch ii show lower virulence and transmissibility, with an average mortality rate of approximately 3.6%. geographically, branch i strains are primarily prevalent in regions such as the congo, cameroon, and sudan in africa, whereas branch ii strains have spread across the continent, leading to intercontinental transmission and resulting in mpox outbreaks in non-endemic countries like the united states and the united kingdom. some researchers have conducted genomic comparisons between the b.1 lineage strains found in non-endemic countries like the united states and germany in 2022 and the mpxv strains circulating in nigeria from 2017 to 2019. they discovered approximately 50 single nucleotide polymorphism sites of difference, with an snp mutation rate more than six times that of other poxviruses, suggesting that the b.1 strain has a higher mutation rate and evolutionary speed. from the mpxv strains first identified in 1970 to the currently circulating strains, evolution has primarily manifested at the genetic level. mpxv continuously evolves through mechanisms such as point mutations, gene deletions, and recombination. for instance, the virus utilizes the host’s apolipoprotein b mrna-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 cytidine deaminase to induce conversions of cytosines to uracils in foreign dna during the viral replication process, leading to point mutations that facilitate the formation of new lineages. epidemiological studies demonstrate that the virulence of mpxv varies across different evolutionary branches. the median lethal dose of the west african branch is 1.29 × 105 pfu per animal, while that of the central african branch is 5.9 × 103 pfu per animal, indicating higher virulence in the central african branch. in animal experiments, prairie dogs inoculated with different doses of the central african strain exhibited high morbidity and mortality rates, whereas those inoculated with the west african strain survived with minimal disease symptoms, providing experimental evidence for the differences in virulence between the two branches. at the genomic level, the nucleotide sequence similarity between the central african and west african branches is 99.5%, while the amino acid sequence similarity is 99.4%. the most significant genetic differences between the two branches are observed in the br-203, br-209, and cop-c3l genes. br-203 is a homolog of the myxoma virus m-t4 gene, which encodes a 221 amino acid protein. during myxv infection, m-t4 primarily resides in the endoplasmic reticulum, enhancing viral virulence and inhibiting apoptosis in infected cells. in mpxv branch i, br-203 encodes the full 221 amino acid protein; however, due to two base pair deletions in branch ii, it only encodes an n-terminal fragment of approximately 51 amino acids, leading to premature termination of translation and weakening the gene’s functionality. the br-209 gene encodes a 326 amino acid protein that functions as an il-1β-binding protein, preventing il-1β from binding to its receptor and inhibiting the inflammatory response. in mpxv branch i, the br-209 gene encodes a complete protein consisting of an n-terminal 210 amino acids and a c-terminal 126 amino acids. in branch ii, a single base insertion near the n-terminal and a four-base deletion result in the encoding of only a fragment comprising an n-terminal 163 amino acids and a c-terminal 132 amino acids. it remains unclear whether this difference in n-terminal length is related to the virulence differences between the central and west african branches and requires further investigation. the cop-c3l gene encodes a 263 amino acid complement control protein, referred to in mpxv as the mpox complement inhibitor, which encodes a protein of 216 amino acids. this protein inhibits the complement pathway through a mechanism similar to mammalian complement activation regulators. although the complement control protein of mpxv has some base pair deletions, it still retains certain complement inhibitory functions. however, the cop-c3l gene is not expressed in branch ii, which may be one of the reasons for the differences in virulence between the two branches. research has shown that integrating mopice into branch ii did not fully elevate its virulence to that of branch i, but it altered the disease manifestation and accelerated disease progression. mpxv primarily spreads through rodent species such as gambian pouched rats and dormice, with humans and monkeys acting as incidental hosts; therefore, this virus is classified as a zoonotic disease. the transmission of mpxv occurs through two main routes: animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission. animal-to-human transmission occurs through direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids, or lesions of infected animals. human-to-human transmission primarily happens through contact with lesions, scabs, saliva, or other bodily fluids from infected individuals, as well as through contact with contaminated objects, such as clothing or towels that have not been disinfected. although mpxv is not a typical sexually transmitted disease, viral dna has been detected in semen, indicating its potential for sexual transmission. in the context of modern open societal environments, the risk of sexual transmission of mpxv may heighten public awareness of sexually transmitted diseases, thereby reducing the occurrence of high-risk sexual behaviors. additionally, mpxv can be transmitted vertically to the fetus through the placenta during pregnancy and can also be transmitted to newborns during or after delivery through close contact. a study conducted in the democratic republic of the congo reported four pregnant women infected with mpxv, with only one newborn being born healthy. while vaccination against smallpox is not recommended for pregnant women, infants in regions where mpox is endemic should receive the smallpox vaccine promptly to prevent infection. further research is needed to assess the potential impact of mpxv on pregnant women and appropriate response measures. epidemiological reports indicate that past mpox cases have primarily occurred in children and adolescents. from 1970 to 1989, the majority of mpox infections in africa were among children, with a median age of infection of 4 years. in contrast, during the periods of 2000–2009 and 2010–2019, the median age of infection increased to 10 years and 21 years, respectively, indicating a gradual rise in the age of onset over time. by 2022, during the mpox outbreak in non-endemic countries, 79% of cases occurred in adult males aged 18 to 44, with a median age of 36 years. this shift may be related to the interruption of smallpox vaccination programs. the smallpox vaccine provides up to 85% cross-protection against mpxv; however, since smallpox was declared eradicated in the 1980s, vaccination ceased for individuals born after 1980, resulting in increased susceptibility to mpxv among these populations. additionally, studies have shown that the infection rates of mpxv are similar between males and females. however, during the mpox outbreaks in 2022, many cases were concentrated within the men who have sex with men community. reports from the centers for disease control and prevention indicated that the majority of mpox cases in the 2022 outbreak were among gay men, significantly increasing the infection risk for specific populations, including homosexuals, bisexuals, and transgender individuals. the immune function of mpox -infected individuals is correlated with the severity of mpxv infection. research has shown that hiv-positive individuals exhibit more pronounced symptoms after mpxv infection, including rashes, fever, genital ulcers, inguinal lymphadenopathy, and necrotic lesions in the perianal area, genitals, oral cavity, trunk, and face. during the mpxv outbreak in nigeria from 2017 to 2018, more than half of mpox -related deaths occurred in patients co-infected with hiv. co-infection with hiv and mpxv leads to prolonged disease courses, more severe lesions, difficulties in healing, and a higher incidence of secondary bacterial infections and genital ulcers. a recent report documented cases of hiv-positive individuals co-infected with mpxv and syphilis, exhibiting extremely severe symptoms, including systemic mpox manifestations along with necrosis of the nose and severe infections of the penis and oral mucosa. therefore, individuals who are unvaccinated, engage in high-risk sexual behaviors, have compromised immune systems, are elderly, or are children should be prioritized for protection against mpxv infection. currently, the predominant mpxv strains circulating globally are derived from the b.1 lineage, which is a micro-evolutionary branch of the iib clade. this lineage is characterized by an enhanced adaptability to humans during its evolution, exhibiting stronger transmissibility but lower pathogenicity, with a mortality rate of less than 1%. epidemiological investigations have indicated that, since the cessation of smallpox vaccination, global immunity to orthopoxviruses has gradually declined, as evidenced by the increasing median age of mpox cases. early mpxv infections were primarily confined to central and west africa, with sporadic cases occurring in other continents, though their impact was minimal. with the acceleration of globalization, the mpox outbreak in 2022 demonstrated that mpxv has acquired new genetic mutations during its prolonged evolutionary process, leading to a significant increase in cases among individuals with no travel history to endemic regions. this indicates that mpxv has the potential to continue evolving and could trigger large-scale outbreaks similar to smallpox. therefore, countries urgently need to implement existing preventive measures to actively curb the spread of mpox. clinical manifestations of mpox mpxv infection presents similarly to varv and is classified as a self-limiting disease. after infection, mpxv enters the host through various transmission routes and has an incubation period of 5 to 21 days. upon completion of the incubation period, patients typically exhibit signs akin to those of viral infections, including fever, headache, lymphadenopathy, chills, fatigue, lethargy, and myalgia. after 1 to 3 days of fever, a rash usually begins to appear, starting on the face and then spreading to the trunk and limbs, forming large rashes that can number from a few to thousands. the evolution of the rash includes macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, and finally crusting and desquamation. the course of the disease typically lasts 2 to 4 weeks, after which the lesions generally heal, leaving atrophic scars. in certain severe cases, complications may arise, including conjunctivitis, corneal infections, encephalitis, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, bronchopneumonia, syphilis, gonorrhea, herpes simplex, and genital chlamydia infections. prior to 2022, among the circulating mpxv strains, male patients accounted for approximately 55%, slightly more than female patients. the rash was predominantly located on the head and neck, trunk, limbs, and genital region, usually exhibiting a centrifugal distribution and can be widespread. although it has been reported that approximately 99% of cases during the 2022 mpox outbreak occurred in male patients, another study has indicated a substantial proportion of cases among women as well, accounting for 17.22% of infections. overall, the 2022 mpox outbreak disproportionately affected men compared to women. the incubation period was shorter, and rashes were primarily distributed in the genital area, perianal area, trunk, limbs, and head and neck, with the perianal and genital regions often being the initial sites of rash development. furthermore, in the 2022 mpox cases, about half of the patients’ rashes did not follow the typical progression, potentially skipping one or more rash stages. most patients had fewer than 10 rashes, with 10% of patients presenting with only one rash. the rash at the initial site frequently appeared as a “doughnut-like” pseudopustule, characterized by raised edges and a central dimple. patients with compromised immune function, such as those infected with hiv or those with other immunosuppressive conditions, tended to have larger lesions with deeper inflammation, which could result in wart-like plaques or large ulcers, prolonged healing times, and significant scarring. in this outbreak, traditional prodromal symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and headache were milder and even absent, with these symptoms appearing not only before the rash but also during or after its onset. lymphadenopathy also presented differently; while systemic lymphadenopathy was common in previous outbreaks, in this outbreak, it was often limited to one or two sites associated with the rash, and the swollen lymph nodes shifted from the cervical region to the groin. additionally, patients who engaged in anal intercourse may exhibit rectal involvement, presenting with symptoms such as rectal-perianal pain, hematochezia, diarrhea, and tenesmus. in severe cases, ulcerative lesions may develop near the intestinal mucosa, leading to intestinal perforation. due to inflammation potentially involving all layers of the skin, rashes often accompanied by edema could lead to significant swelling of the penis and scrotum when lesions appear in the male genital area. in severe cases, multiple rashes may coalesce, potentially affecting the urethra, leading to urinary difficulties and hematuria, which may require surgical intervention. diagnostic techniques for mpox due to the extremely similar clinical presentations caused by different orthopoxviruses, it is challenging to diagnose mpox solely based on infection symptoms. therefore, diagnostic techniques with high sensitivity and rapid detection rates are crucial for controlling outbreaks. currently, polymerase chain reaction and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction are the conventional methods of choice for detecting suspected mpxv infections. samples of vesicular exudate and scab material are typically used to confirm mpxv infection. in pcr, mpxv is specifically identified by detecting an 8-bp deletion in the gene encoding the a-type inclusions protein. real-time pcr selects the conserved regions of the b6r, e9l, c3l, f3l, and n3r genes as amplification targets. other techniques, such as isothermal amplification, are efficient and rapid but may produce non-specific amplification, necessitating precise primer design; these methods are still under investigation. virus isolation and culture are classical diagnostic methods, with mpxv growing well in cell lines such as hela and vero, as well as in chick embryos. however, isolating and culturing mpxv must be performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory or higher, and should be conducted by experienced personnel. despite the implementation of comprehensive personal protective measures, there remains a risk of infection. electron microscopy can identify viral particles in rashes, vesicles, and scabs. however, these particles appear similar to those of other orthopoxviruses under the microscope, indicating only that the virus belongs to the orthopoxvirus genus and not specifying the exact species. moreover, electron microscopy requires a high level of knowledge from the operator, and there are certain infection risks associated with the sample preparation process. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay can detect specific igm and igg antibodies in the serum of mpox patients 1 to 4 weeks after the appearance of rashes. however, due to its lower specificity, it is susceptible to interference from cross-reactivity with other orthopoxviruses. treatment and prognosis of mpox during the 2003 mpox outbreak in the united states, the cdc suggested that administration of the smallpox vaccine within 2 weeks of infection might alleviate disease severity. however, the vaccine was neither made publicly available nor routinely used in mpox patients. this was largely due to high production costs relative to the limited number of cases, as well as concerns over safety. live smallpox vaccines have been associated with serious adverse events in vulnerable populations, including cryptococcal meningitis, myocarditis, pneumonia, vision loss, and complications during pregnancy. for severe mpox cases, more intensive interventions may be required. these include cross-protective vaccines such as acam2000, jynneos, and vaccinia immune globulin intravenous, along with antiviral agents developed for smallpox—namely tecovirimat, cidofovir, and brincidofovir. currently, effective antiviral therapies specifically approved for the clinical treatment of mpox remain limited. as a result, antiviral agents originally developed and stockpiled for smallpox—such as tecovirimat, cidofovir, and brincidofovir—are currently being repurposed for mpox management under the protocols of the u.s. strategic national stockpile. tecovirimat, a small-molecule inhibitor targeting the vp37 protein on the surface of orthopoxviruses, is the first-line treatment for patients with severe or high-risk disease—such as immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, and children. it is available under an expanded-access investigational new drug protocol. although randomized trials have demonstrated tecovirimat’s safety, they have not shown a significant reduction in lesion healing time. in cases of progressive disease, treatment failure, or suspected resistance, combination therapy with brincidofovir or intravenous cidofovir is recommended, both accessible through emergency-use frameworks. cidofovir, a nucleotide analog inhibiting viral dna polymerase, has demonstrated efficacy in vitro and in animal models but is limited in clinical use due to its nephrotoxicity. brincidofovir, a lipid-conjugated derivative of cidofovir approved in 2021 for smallpox, offers improved oral bioavailability and intracellular activation. it has shown survival benefit in preclinical models, although clinical data in mpox remain sparse. its adverse effects—including gastrointestinal disturbances and transient elevations in liver enzymes—necessitate careful monitoring during treatment. while it is better tolerated than cidofovir, brincidofovir has a less favorable safety profile than tecovirimat. vaccinia immune globulin may be considered for immunocompromised individuals or those with ocular involvement, although its effectiveness in mpox is not yet well established. treatment decisions should be tailored to individual clinical scenarios and guided by cdc recommendations, especially in light of emerging antiviral resistance and the complexity of severe cases. mpox is generally a self-limiting disease, with most immunocompetent patients recovering within two to four weeks. supportive care remains the cornerstone of management and includes antipyretics, analgesics, fluid and electrolyte balance, skin hygiene to prevent secondary infections, and antibiotics when indicated. however, in vulnerable populations—such as young children, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, and persons living with hiv—mpox can progress to severe or even fatal outcomes. prognosis in these groups hinges on prompt antiviral therapy and comprehensive supportive measures. despite progress in therapeutic options, several key challenges remain. first, high-quality randomized controlled trials are lacking, and current treatment recommendations are based primarily on observational data or preclinical studies. second, viral evolution—particularly mutations in genes encoding vp37 or dna polymerase—may reduce drug sensitivity. third, access to antiviral agents remains uneven, especially in endemic and resource-limited regions, further exacerbating global health disparities. to overcome these limitations, ongoing research is exploring innovative approaches, including host-directed therapies, immunomodulatory drugs, and mpxv-specific monoclonal antibodies. well-designed multicenter clinical trials and longitudinal cohort studies are urgently needed to determine treatment efficacy and establish standardized, evidence-based protocols for diverse patient populations. public health challenges of the mpox outbreak since the global resurgence of mpox in 2022, the disease has posed significant challenges to public health systems worldwide. these challenges are multifaceted, encompassing issues of vaccine equity, disease surveillance, public communication, healthcare infrastructure, and international policy coordination. understanding these challenges is critical to preventing future large-scale outbreaks and mitigating the public health burden of mpox. the cessation of smallpox vaccination after the disease’s eradication in 1980 has left a vast proportion of the global population without immunity to orthopoxviruses, including mpxv. this immunity gap is particularly evident in individuals born after 1980, who now constitute the majority of the global adult population. although vaccines such as jynneos and acam2000 are available, access remains heavily skewed toward high-income countries. in contrast, many low- and middle-income countries, including those in africa where mpox is endemic, face considerable barriers to vaccine acquisition, including supply chain limitations, financial constraints, and regulatory delays. this inequitable distribution undermines global containment efforts and exacerbates the vulnerability of high-risk populations. the 2022 outbreak revealed a disproportionate impact on men who have sex with men. while this has important epidemiological implications, it has also led to stigma and misinformation that hindered case reporting, contact tracing, and access to healthcare. in some regions, individuals avoided testing or treatment due to fear of discrimination. public health messaging that is inclusive, nonjudgmental, and culturally sensitive is essential to address this issue. furthermore, overemphasis on msm populations risks obscuring other transmission routes and susceptible groups, potentially leading to incomplete surveillance. accurate and timely surveillance is a cornerstone of epidemic response. however, mpox surveillance is still fragmented globally. many endemic regions lack robust infrastructure for genomic sequencing, contact tracing, and rapid diagnostics. even in non-endemic countries, the initial response to the 2022 outbreak was delayed due to a lack of familiarity with the disease and insufficient diagnostic capacity. strengthening surveillance systems and integrating mpox testing into broader infectious disease platforms are crucial for early detection and containment. many health systems, particularly in resource-constrained settings, are ill-equipped to manage additional outbreaks such as mpox. during the covid-19 pandemic, healthcare personnel and facilities were already strained, and the emergence of mpox added further pressure. this is especially concerning in contexts with limited isolation wards, inadequate training on poxvirus infection control, and insufficient stockpiles of personal protective equipment and antivirals. integrating mpox preparedness into broader epidemic response frameworks is essential to building resilience. although the world health organization declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern in 2022, international responses were inconsistent. some countries instituted aggressive contact tracing and ring vaccination programs, while others delayed action or downplayed the threat. this lack of coordinated strategy reflects a broader challenge in global health governance—ensuring timely, equitable, and science-based responses across geopolitical boundaries. future frameworks must emphasize international collaboration, resource sharing, and equitable policy implementation. conclusion although mpxv was first identified decades ago, its recent global resurgence—particularly since 2022—marks a new phase in its epidemiological significance. genetic evolution, increased human-to-human transmissibility, and the absence of population-wide smallpox vaccination have contributed to widespread susceptibility. our review highlights critical findings in mpxv virology, pathogenic mechanisms, and diagnostic tools, which are essential for guiding clinical and scientific responses. however, beyond biomedical understanding, the current outbreak underscores profound public health challenges. the lack of equitable access to vaccines, persistent surveillance and diagnostic gaps, health system limitations in resource-poor settings, and social stigma—especially affecting msm populations—have collectively hindered effective outbreak control. moreover, fragmented international responses point to the urgent need for coordinated global strategies. going forward, successful containment of mpox will depend not only on scientific innovation but also on inclusive public health policies, international cooperation, and investment in pandemic preparedness infrastructure. a unified, equity-centered approach is essential to ensure that mpxv does not evolve into a persistent and preventable global health threat.
current insights into diagnosis, prevention strategies, treatment, therapeutic targets, and challenges of monkeypox infections in human populations abstract in the wake of the emergence and worldwide respread of a viral infection called monkeypox, there is a serious threat to the health and safety of the global population. this viral infection was endemic to the western and central parts of africa, but has recently spread out of this endemic area to various countries, including the united kingdom, portugal, spain, the united states of america, canada, sweden, belgium, italy, australia, germany, france, the netherlands, israel, and mexico. this is a timely review focusing on recent findings and developments in the epidemiology, clinical features, therapeutic targets, diagnosis, prevention mechanisms, research challenges and possible treatment for mpox. to date, there have been around 81,225 reported cases of mpox. in most cases, this illness is mild; however, there is a fatality rate ranging from 1 to 10%, which might be increased due to associated complications and/or secondary infections. there is a real challenge in the diagnosis of mpox, since its symptoms are very similar to those of other infections, including smallpox and chickenpox. generally, to prevent/limit the risk and transmission of mpox, the detection and isolation of infected individuals, as well as hand hygiene and cleanliness, are essential and effective approaches to control/combat this viral infection. nevertheless, updated information about mpox from different angles is lacking. thus, this review provides updated and comprehensive information about the mpox illness, which should highlight the global burden, pathogenicity, symptoms, diagnosis, prevention measures and possible treatment of this emerging disease. 1. introduction monkeypox virus is a double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid virus, causing mpox illness in humans and other animals, that is rapidly spreading worldwide. on 29 november 2022, around 81,225 cases of mpox were confirmed and/or suspected from about 111 countries. in addition to the world’s continued fight against the coronavirus disease pandemic, this recently emerging disease has added another global burden to worldwide health. as an added advantage, unlike covid-19, which was detected during the early part of 2020, scientists have gained a great deal of insight into mpox in the past few years. nevertheless, detailed and up-to-date information about mpox is very limited, and the future outcome of this viral infection is not extensively discussed. therefore, this review focuses on the mpox illness in terms of prevalence, transmission and pathogenicity, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approaches, prevention measures, and possible treatment or/and vaccination. 2. survey methodology various scientific search engines, such as sciencedirect, pubmed, scopus, google scholar and medline were used to search and retrieve related published papers/literature about mpox since 1958. the keywords/phrases/sentences that were used to search for relevant papers/literatures/data related to mpox infection in order to generate only mpox infection-related literature were as follows: mpox virus, epidemiology of mpox infection, clinical characteristics of mpox infection, diagnosis and treatment of mpox infection, and pathogenesis of mpox virus. exclusion criteria were also set. studies that did not meet the current inclusion criteria or were irrelevant to the topic, abstracts, conference proceedings, editorials, and commentaries with insufficient data were excluded. 3. history the mpox virus, which is a member of the orthopoxvirus family, causes a zoonotic disease similar to smallpox in humans. the variola virus, the vaccinia virus, and the cowpox virus are all members of this genus. they are 200 to 250 nm brick-shaped enveloped viruses with characteristic surface tubules and a dumb-bell-shaped core component. in the period between 1958 to 1968, a large number of primates were imported from asia, and a few from africa, into europe and the united states to be used in developing and testing the polio vaccine. while they were in transit, they were often accompanied by other wild animals, which created a lot of opportunities for infection to spread. at the statens serum institut, copenhagen, denmark, preben von magnus first noticed mpox in 1958, when he observed two non-fatal outbreaks of mpox affecting laboratory cynomolgus monkeys after 51 and 62 days of the shipments from singapore via air transport. subsequently, while performing routine investigations, it was found that the mpox virus was present in the kidneys of monkeys that showed no symptoms and had otherwise been healthy. in asia, the virus has never been found, and it is generally believed that the occurrence of the virus in asian monkeys is a result of their catching the disease in captivity or in transit. it is thought that some previous cases of a pox outbreak, thought to be smallpox, among monkeys, may have actually been mpox. in the 1960s, several lab monkeys were often found to have mpox in european and american laboratories, including at the walter reed army institute of research in 1962, where several monkeys had antibodies and no symptoms following exposure to mpox. after 1968, there were no more cases of monkeys dying in laboratories, as the conditions for monkeys in labs improved and the number of monkeys coming from asia and africa decreased. until 1965, when mpox was first discovered at rotterdam zoo, it was thought that mpox only occurred in primates. however, the disease was first detected among the giant anteaters from central and south america, before affecting several orangutans, chimpanzees, gorillas, guenons, squirrel monkeys, macaques, marmosets and gibbons, and 11 of the 23 animals died as a result of it. orangutans were most severely affected by the disease. at the time, the mpox virus was also isolated from the kidneys of healthy monkeys, but it was later revealed that the virus was most likely due to contamination from samples from the zoo that were undergoing examination at the same laboratory as the mpox virus. during the smallpox eradication efforts in 1970, the first documented cases of mpox in humans were found in six unvaccinated children, with the first one being in a 9-month-old boy in the democratic republic of the congo. three of the others were from liberia and sierra leone. one notable fact about mpox is that it is less contagious than smallpox. in the period from 1981 to 1986, more than 300 cases of mpox were reported in the drc, the majority of them linked to animal contact. approximately 88% of the cases resulting from human-to-human transmission were reported in the democratic republic of the congo in 1996. in equatorial central and western africa, there are regular outbreaks of viral infections with death rates around 10% and human-to-human transmission rates around the same. there was no outbreak of mpox in the united states until 2003, when a concurrent mpox outbreak took place in the rain forests of western and central africa. a number of cases have been traced back to ghanaian rodents that were imported. prairie dogs in the regions of africa contracted the disease and passed it on to their owners. although deaths in prairie dogs were observed, no human fatality was recorded. it has been reported that the disease had spread to at least ten african countries between 1970 and 2019, mainly in central and west africa. a case of mpox was diagnosed in the united kingdom, in 2018, among two passengers who had travelled from nigeria. in the uk, the first case of human-to-human transmission outside of africa was confirmed in that year. it is possible that the person contracted the disease from contaminated bed linen, while working as a healthcare worker. after that, more cases were reported in the uk between 2019 and 2021. the disease has also been reported in travellers from israel and singapore. 4. origin and spread of mpox virus since the first human case of mpox was reported in the democratic republic of the congo, over 65 years ago, there have been various outbreaks and sporadic cases in many areas of central and west africa. it has been reported that most cases have occurred in remote rainforest areas of the congo basin, particularly in the democratic republic of the congo. human cases have also increasingly been reported in parts of central and western africa. a total of 11 african countries have reported human mpox cases since 1970, including benin, cameroon, the central african republic, the democratic republic of the congo, gabon, cote d’ivoire, liberia, nigeria, the republic of the congo, sierra leone and south sudan. during 1996–97, the democratic republic of the congo experienced an outbreak that was characterized by a lower-case fatality ratio and a higher attack rate than normal. it was found, in this case, that chickenpox and mpox were occurring concurrently. this could explain any observed changes in transmission dynamics in this case. the outbreak in nigeria that began in 2017 was a large one, with over 500 suspected cases and 200 confirmed cases, and a case fatality ratio of approximately 3%. until this day, cases continue to come to light. since mpox does not only affect countries in africa, but the rest of the world as well, the disease is of global importance when it comes to public health. a mpox outbreak occurred in the united states in 2003, the first mpox outbreak outside of africa, and the cause was found to be contact with infected pet prairie dogs. they were housed together with gambian pouched rats and dormice that were imported into the country from ghana. during this outbreak, over 70 cases of mpox were reported in the united states. mpox has also been reported to have been transferred from travellers from nigeria to israel as well as to travellers from the uk, united states of america and singapore. multiple mpox cases have been reported in several countries outside the endemic area since may 2022. currently, there are studies being conducted to better understand the epidemiology, sources of infection, and patterns of transmission of the disease. a zoonotic transmission can take place through direct contact with blood, bodily fluids or by contact with the lesions on the skin or mucosa of animals that are infected. there has been evidence of mpox virus infection in many species of animals found in africa, including tree squirrels, rope squirrels, gambian pouched rats, and dormice, as well as various monkey species. it remains unclear which animal is the natural reservoir for mpox, but rodents would probably be the most likely. it is possible to contract the disease from eating infected meat that has not been properly cooked. in some cases, people living in or near forested areas may be indirectly exposed to infected animals due to their proximity. transmission of the virus from person-to-person can be caused by close contact with respiratory secretions, lesions on the skin of an infected person, or recently contaminated objects. health workers, household members and other close contacts of persons who are infected with the disease are at greater risk, as droplet respiratory particles are required to transmit the infection via prolonged face-to-face contact. it has been documented in the past few years that the longest ever documented chain of transmission has increased from six to nine successive person-to-person infections within one community. there is also the possibility that mpox can be transmitted via the placenta from a mother to a foetus. the close physical contact that can occur in the context of mpox is well known as a risk factor for transmission; as of now, it is clear that mpox can be transmitted specifically through sexual means. therefore, it is important to conduct further research to gain a better understanding of the disease. 5. transmission and circulation of mpox in human populations mpox first became known to humans in 1970 in basankusu, équateur province, in the democratic republic of the congo. the who recorded 338 confirmed cases between 1981 and 1986 in the democratic republic of the congo/zaire. in 1996–1997, a second outbreak of human illness was reported in the democratic republic of the congo and zaire province. between 1991 and 1999, there were 511 cases reported in the democratic republic of the congo/zaire. the congo basin clade of diseases still continues to be endemic in the drc and has a high case fatality ratio. by may 2022, the case fatality rate for outbreaks from the past had been around 3% to 6%, while the cfr for the outbreak that occurred in 2022 remained less than 1%. there was no record of human-to-human transmission of mpox until the 2022 outbreak of mpox in europe. in 2003, mpox was reported in the midwestern united states among owners of pet prairie dogs belonging to clade ii, the first outbreak outside africa. there were reportedly 71 people infected with the disease, none of whom died as a result. mpox has traditionally been associated with tropical rainforests and their ecology. it was only in 2005 that the pattern was broken, when 49 cases of the disease were reported in south sudan with no deaths. genetic analysis indicates that the virus did not originate in sudan, but was imported from the democratic republic of the congo. a significant increase in mpox cases has occurred in central and western africa, especially in the democratic republic of the congo, where 2000 cases per year have been reported between 2011 and 2014. there are many instances in which the data collected is incomplete or unconfirmed, causing unrealistic estimations of the number of mpox cases over a period of time. in spite of this, it has been suggested that the number of reported cases of mpox has increased and the geographical occurrences became more widespread in 2018. 5.1. united states outbreak an infant became ill after being bitten by a prairie dog bought at a swap meet near milwaukee, wisconsin, in may 2003. a total of 71 cases of mpox had been reported by the end of 2003. all of the cases have been linked to the importation of gambian pouched rats from accra, ghana, in april 2003, by an exotic animal distributor in texas. there were no reported deaths from this outbreak. a mpox patient generally experiences prodromal symptoms, such as fever, headaches, muscle aches, chills, drenching sweats, and drenching fever, when they have mpox. infected individuals were found to have non-productive coughs in about a third of the cases. 5.2. nigeria outbreak a mpox outbreak was reported in the south-eastern and southern parts of nigeria. the virus spread to the following states: akwaibom, abia, bayelsa, benue, cross river, delta, edo, ekiti, enugu, imo, lagos, nasarawa, oyo, plateau, rivers and federal capital territory. according to the information provided by the nigeria center for disease control, a total of ten cases of mpox in humans were reported during the period of 1971 to 1978. after almost 39 years, the outbreak started again in september 2017, and it has continued across multiple states as of may 2019. in 2017, the first case of mpox in humans was reported from the state bayelsa. the outbreak was characterized by infection, predominantly among young, male adults, without significant transmission to others, which is different from previous reports of the west african clade that includes all descendants of one common ancestor). several cases of genital ulcers, syphilis and hiv co-infection, as reported by the niger delta university teaching hospital, were found in young adults. there have been reports from the us center for disease control and prevention that american travellers who have returned from lagos and ibadan have contracted mpox. 5.3. united kingdom cases there was a case of mpox reported in the uk for the first time in september 2018. it is believed that the person, a nigerian citizen, contracted mpox in nigeria before travelling to the uk. in accordance with public health england, the individual had been staying at a naval base in cornwall when he was moved to the royal free hospital’s unit for infectious diseases. the people who had been in contact with the patient since he contracted the disease were contacted. there was a second case in the town of blackpool, england, along with yet another case that was associated with a medical staff member treating the blackpool case. a fourth mpox case was reported in england on 3 december 2019, when a person in southwest england was diagnosed with the disease. this individual had travelled from nigeria to the uk. a large outbreak of mpox has been reported in the uk in 2022 as part of the larger epidemic of mpox caused by the west african clade of the mpox virus. a total of 3504 cases of mpox have been confirmed as of 3 october 2022, and 150 cases are highly probable. 5.4. singapore case it was reported on 8 may 2019 that a 38-year-old man from nigeria, who had travelled to singapore from nigeria, was hospitalized in an isolation ward at the national centre for infectious diseases in singapore after it was confirmed that he was the first mpox case in singapore. this resulted in the quarantining of 22 individuals. the case may have been connected to an outbreak that was occurring concurrently in nigeria. 5.5. 2021 cases as of the 24th of may, public health wales had identified three cases of mpox from a single household in the uk. health secretary matt hancock announced the cases in an address to the house of commons. it was noted that the person with the infected organism had travelled from nigeria. it was reported that a second case occurred on 2nd june, and a third case was reported on 24th june. there was a case of mpox in the us on the 14th of july after an american returned from nigeria following a trip to the country. the virus was later identified as being a member of the west african clade of mpox virus. 5.6. current outbreak mpox was confirmed as a continuing outbreak in may of 2022, beginning with a cluster of cases reported from the uk. the first confirmed case of the disease was identified on 6 may 2022 and occurred in a traveller from nigeria; however, there is some evidence that cases had already been spreading in europe during the preceding months. a steadily growing number of cases have been reported from an increasing number of countries and regions since 18 may 2018, most notably from north and south america, asia, africa, and australia. as of 9 june, 1290 new cases have been confirmed. 6. clinical features mpox has an incubation period that is usually between six and thirteen days but could be anywhere from five to twenty. the duration of the infection can be split into two periods. the initial phase of the infection is characterized by fever, severe headache, lymphadenopathy, back pain, myalgia and intense asthenia. lymphadenopathy is a distinctive feature of mpox compared to other diseases that may initially appear similar. an eruption of the skin usually begins within one to three days after the appearance of fever. it is more common for the rash to appear on the face and extremities rather than on the trunk when the condition is present. in 95% of cases, the face and palms of the hands are affected, whereas it only affects 75% of cases on the soles of the feet. aside from the oral mucous membranes, other types of mucous membrane, genitalia, conjunctivas, and corneas, are also affected. generally, the lesions begin as macules and then progress into papules, vesicles, pustules, and crusts, which eventually dry up and fall off. in general, there are between a few and several thousand lesions present. lesions can coalesce and slough off in large sections when they are severe enough. an infection of mpox usually lasts from two to four weeks, with symptoms lasting from the start of the disease to the end. infection severity is more common in children and is dependent on the level of virus exposure, the patient’s health status, and the type of complications. the severity of the infection may be affected by underlying immunodeficiencies. owing to the cessation of smallpox vaccination campaigns globally after the eradication of the disease, persons younger than 40 to 50 years of age may be more susceptible to mpox than in the past because of their immune systems being ineffective against smallpox. in addition, mpox can also cause secondary infections such as bronchopneumonia, sepsis, encephalitis and corneal infection with ensuing loss of vision. the extent to which infections may occur asymptomatically is not known. during the outbreak of mpox in 2022, many of the patients presented with genital and peri-anal lesions, fever, swollen lymph nodes, and pain when swallowing, with some of the patients manifesting only a few sores as a result of the disease. in the general population, the case fatality ratio for mpox historically ranges from 0 to 11%, while young children’s case fatality rates tend to be higher. currently, it is estimated that the case fatality ratio is between 3 and 6%. 7. diagnosis among other possible diagnoses that must be considered when making a clinical differential diagnosis are chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, syphilis and medication-associated allergies. lymphadenopathy is a clinical feature that assists in distinguishing mpox from chickenpox or smallpox at the prodromal stage of the illness. if mpox is suspected, a sample should be collected and safely transported to a laboratory with the necessary capabilities. in order to confirm the presence of mpox, skin lesion material including swabs of the lesion surface and/or exudate, roofs from multiple lesions, or crusts from skin lesions, are the recommended specimen type for laboratory testing via conventional polymerase chain reaction, real-time pcr, or pcr in combination with dna sequencing. therefore, specimens should be packaged according to national and international requirements and should be shipped accordingly. the traditional techniques of viral isolation and electron microscopy, as well as immunohistochemistry, remain valid, but require advanced technical skills and a sophisticated laboratory. specimens can be examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction to detect orthopoxvirus and mpox virus. these methods are sensitive and can detect viral dna efficiently. presently, real-time pcr works best in a major laboratory, which limits its application as a real-time diagnostic tool in rural areas with limited resources. the use of real-time pcr for diagnostic purposes outside of major laboratories may become more feasible due to advances in technology. antibody-based diagnostics can be used to determine the cause of cases identified retrospectively. orthopoxvirus immunological assays are cross-reactive with a variety of orthopoxviruses, making them useful in areas where the virus responsible for the illness is already known. for retrospective patients who have been exposed to orthopoxviruses, including through vaccination, anti-orthopoxvirus antibody g, alone, is not enough to diagnose the disease. however, serological assays assessing anti-orthopoxvirus immunoglobulin m are more useful for diagnosing recent retrospective infections, including in individuals who have previously been vaccinated. the most appropriate samples for diagnosing mpox are from the skin lesions—the roof and the fluid from vesicles and pustules, and the crusts of the skin lesions. biopsies can also be performed under certain circumstances. it is essential to store lesion samples in a sterile dry tube and to keep them cold. a pcr test is usually inconclusive since viremia tends to last only for a short time relative to the time the specimens are collected after symptoms begin, and specimens cannot be collected routinely from patients. there has been little progress in developing a point-of-care test that can be deployed in the field. based on lesion samples from acute infections caused by orthopoxvirus, a recent pilot study of the tetracore orthopox bio threat alert showed promising results. this assay has shown that vaccinia and mpox viruses can be reliably detected in serum preparations containing 107 plaque-forming units/ml; five out of six clinical specimens were correctly identified. despite not being specific to the mpox virus, this assay could be used for orthopoxvirus confirmation by proxy in mpox-endemic areas, and it is critical to test this in endemic settings. currently, the who recommend nucleic acid amplification testing to detect the mpox viral genome, hemagglutinin, the acidophilic-type inclusion body and the crmb genes. however, there is still a need for developing assays that can be tested in very basic environments with limited training of personnel, since patients with mpox virus often seek diagnosis and care at rural clinics and hospitals without electricity. specific information is critical to allow for an accurate interpretation of test results such as the date of the onset of fever, the date of the onset of rash, the date of specimen collection, the current state of the individual’s condition, and the patient’s age. 8. therapeutics and vaccines clinical care for mpox should be fully optimized to alleviate symptoms, manage complications, and prevent long-term sequelae. patients should be offered fluids and food to maintain adequate nutritional status and treated for any secondary bacterial infections, which can lead to a high mortality rate, especially in critically ill patients. during outbreaks, several treatments are used to tackle these infections. for example, an antiviral agent known as tecovirimat, or tpoxx, st-246, is fda approved for smallpox infections. it is currently used for other orthopoxvirus infections, including mpox-infected patients in animal and human studies, but it is still not fda approved for clinical use. the use of tecovirimat should be monitored in a clinical research context with prospective data collection. the information about a few drugs that can be utilized for the treatment of mpox infection are presented here. 8.1. tecovirimat tecovirimat is an antiviral drug that has been approved by the united states food and drug administration to treat smallpox infection in adults, as well as children. it is recommended to take antiviral medication for those who have severe illness, or those who are at risk of developing it, or who have lesions in their eyes, mouth, or anogenital region that may signal the presence of the disease. although there are no clinical data available at this time regarding tecovirimat, it appears to be well-tolerated and has the potential of decreasing the duration of an infection and the shedding of viral particles. there is currently a clinical trial being carried out to assess how well tecovirimat treats mpox. the center for disease control and prevention recommends taking the medication tecovirimat for pregnant or nursing women who have been infected with mpox virus. in spite of this, the only source of information regarding the effects of tecovirimat on the foetus comes from animal studies. in those studies, tecovirimat was administered orally to animals at doses approximately 23 times higher than those that are generally recommended for humans in the form of a prescription drug. however, no specific adverse effects on the foetus were observed during the study. there are many children with mpox that need to be treated with tecovirimat if they have severe disease, such as airway obstruction, confluent lesions, and encephalitis. in addition, tecovirimat treatment may be needed for those that have consequences, as well as lesions involving anatomical sites that would cause scarring or strictures. the use of antiviral medication should be considered an option for children under the age of eight, children suffering from conditions such as eczema and other skin disorders, as well as children with immunocompromised systems. the safety experiments on about 360 volunteers were conducted as part of the approval process to determine whether tecovirimat has any adverse effects, and the results showed that its adverse effect profile was comparable to that of a placebo. as far as side effects are concerned, headaches, nausea, and abdominal pain are the most commonly reported side effects. the median time to subjective benefit after commencing tecovirimat was three days after the start of the medication in a study that included 255 patients. it is also effective against mpox infection in nonhuman primates. 8.2. cidofovir in 2012, the fda approved a new antiviral drug called cidofovir. the drug is an injection-based antiviral drug that is used to treat cytomegalovirus infection retinitis among aids patients. however, it is not known whether cidofovir is effective in treating mpox infection in humans. the effectiveness of cidofovir treatment, however, has been shown in some in vitro and animal studies caused by orthopoxviruses. when a patient suffers from a severe mpox infection, cidofovir may be considered as a possible treatment option, although it is unknown whether the treatment offers any benefits. it has been reported that the use of this drug can have significant adverse effects, such as nephrotoxicity. 8.3. brincidofovir brincidofovir is a formulation of the drug cidofovir that is taken orally. brincidofovir may have a better safety profile than that of cidofovir. it should be noted that when treating cytomegalovirus infections with brincidofovir, serious renal damage or other side effects have not been reported in comparison to the use of cidofovir. the u.s. food and drug administration approved the use of brincidofovir for the treatment of smallpox, starting in june 2021. there have only been a few studies that have documented its effectiveness in treating mpox infection. based on animal studies, brincidofovir has been shown to be effective against orthopoxvirus infections. however, it was documented that three mpox patients who were given brincidofovir, all experienced an increase in liver enzyme levels, resulting in the discontinuation of the treatment. although there is a need to develop strategies to use these drugs in endemic areas to treat disease; nevertheless, natural products and their extracts could be a promising source for potential antiviral drugs. the effectiveness of smallpox vaccination in preventing mpox has been demonstrated to be about 85% in several observational studies. therefore, previous smallpox vaccination could have a mild effect on mpox infection. in most cases, a scar can be found on the upper arm of a person who has previously been vaccinated against smallpox. it should be noted that, at this point in time, the original smallpox vaccines are no longer available to the general public. there is a possibility that some laboratory technicians or health care workers may have received a recent smallpox vaccine to protect them against orthopoxviruses acquired on the job as a result of occupational exposure. the fda approved a second vaccine based on a modified attenuated version of the vaccinia virus for use in 2019 as a preventative management tool for mpox. this vaccine consists of two doses and remains limited in availability. in order to develop smallpox and mpox vaccines, formulations based on the vaccinia virus are utilized due to the cross-protection afforded by the antiviral response to orthopoxviruses. 8.4. potential therapeutic targets a previous study has shown that the mpox genome shares 96.3% of its dna with the smallpox genome, which encodes several essential enzymes and proteins that are important to its survival. consequently, the inhibition of such a broad range of enzymes and proteins through a drug molecule could represent one of the potential therapeutic strategies. a number of important potential therapeutic targets for treating mpox infection are discussed here. 8.5. thymidylate kinase as previously reported, thymidylate kinase has been found to form complexes with thymidine diphosphate. this is a novel target of interest due to the fact that no known drugs have yet been developed to target this enzyme. it has been found that a48r plays an important role in the conversion of thymidine monophosphate into its diphosphate, as well as in the conversion of the analogues of 5′ halogenated deoxyuridine monophosphate into its diphosphate. since the active site of human thymidylate kinase exhibits substantial structural differences from the structurally related human analogue, it might become an attractive target for the development of thymidine analogues without being too concerned with restricting the function of the human analogue. 8.6. dna ligase dna ligase is an important enzyme, which is essential for virus replication. a mutation at its n-terminus has resulted in instances of resistance to antiviral drugs in this protein. this location of resistance mutations indicates that the active site of the drug is situated at this location, which makes it a valuable target for drug discovery. 8.7. d13l a major capsid protein, d13l, is part of a protein trimer complex and contributes to the rigidity of the membrane of the virus particles; thus is particularly important in the morphogenesis of the viral particle. there is a strong correlation between rifampin and the d13l protein in the vaccinia virus, which has previously been demonstrated to have an affinity for this protein. as a result of its ability to bind to the d13l trimer complex, rifampin has been demonstrated to inhibit poxvirus assembly, an effect independent of its antibacterial activity. 8.8. f13l a drug called tecovirimat is the only drug approved to treat poxviruses that target the f13l gene. as a major envelope protein, as well as a palmitoylated membrane protein, it plays a crucial role in the formation of extracellular envelope viruses as well as the entry of viruses into cells. 8.9. i7l there is a proteinase known as i7l core proteinase that is a cysteine proteinase which cleaves the major structural and membrane proteins of both viruses and bacteria. as a result of their essential role in the replication of viruses by cleaving precursor polyproteins, proteases are ideal therapeutic targets, and protease inhibitors for other viruses, such as hiv, have also been confirmed to be effective against other viral proteases. due to this, mpox virus proteases are also attractive targets for inhibiting the replication of the virus. previously, ttp-6171 was identified as an inhibitor of the i7l enzyme in previous studies. there is also the possibility that drug-resistant i7l can be generated with mutations on the i7l gene. 9. prevention in order to prevent mpox, the main prevention strategy is to raise awareness about the risk factors, and to educate people about the steps they can take to reduce their exposure to the virus. scientists are currently studying whether and to what extent vaccination would be effective in the prevention and treatment of mpox in many countries around the globe. as a result, certain countries have policies in place, or are developing policies, to provide vaccines to persons who may be at risk, such as laboratory personnel, rapid response teams, and healthcare workers. as a means of preventing mpox, it is necessary to reduce the risk of the disease spreading from human to human. in order to contain an outbreak, it is critical to conduct surveillance, and to identify new cases as soon as possible. close contact with a person who is infected with the human mpox virus is the most significant risk factor for the infection. the risk of infection is higher among health workers and household members. thus, it is recommended that health care workers who are caring for patients or handling specimens of mpox should follow standard infection control precautions. whenever possible, persons who have previously been vaccinated against smallpox should be selected to be caregivers for the patient. the handling of mpox virus-infected people and animals should be carried out by trained personnel who work in laboratories that are appropriately equipped. in accordance with the who guidelines for the transportation of infectious substances, patient specimens must be carefully prepared for transport with three layers of packaging. there are clusters of mpox cases identified in may 2022 in several non-endemic countries with no direct travel ties to endemic areas. this is highly unusual. in order to determine the likely source of infection and limit further spread of the disease, more investigations are in progress. in addition to investigating the source of this outbreak, it is also important to examine all possible means of transmission in order to protect public health. in addition, it is important to reduce the risk of transmission of zoonotic diseases. since the advent of animal-to-human transmissions, most human infections have been transmitted through animals. in order to maintain safety, unprotected touching of wild animals, especially when they are sick or dead, as well as handling or consuming their meat, blood and other parts, must be avoided. furthermore, all foods containing animal meat or animal parts must be thoroughly cooked before consumption. moreover, mpox can also be reduced by limiting the trade in animals, which is another essential step toward the prevention of this disease. in a few countries in the world, legislation has been enacted which imposes restrictions on rodent imports as well as on imports of non-human primates. if captive animals are suspected of being infected with mpox, they should be quarantined from other animals immediately and kept in isolation. it is important to quarantine any animals that might have come into contact with an infected animal, handle them in accordance with the standard precautions, and monitor them for mpox symptoms for at least 30 days after such contact. 10. research challenges with mpox in order to better understand the dynamics of mpox transmission and control, operational research is currently facing challenges, such as insufficient resources for detailed case investigations and contact follow-up in affected communities. a lack of adequate diagnostic facilities in the laboratory is a serious problem. owing to the lack of laboratory diagnosis capacity and access, as well as the difficulty of diagnosing mpox, it is difficult to discover any underlying aetiology. a seroprevalence study would help to understand the epidemiology and subclinical infection among contacts in communities. the currently available serological assays are generic orthopox tests, meaning they do not specifically test for the mpox virus. this is due to the fact that there is cross-reactivity between mpox and smallpox viruses and, therefore, we cannot distinguish between a mpox virus infection and prior smallpox vaccinations or other orthopoxvirus infections. in addition, these assays are not currently available in the marketplace. it has been found that, according to data collected from nigeria, approximately 20% of 70 mpox-negative patients with a rash illness with similar antigens also had orthopox antibodies. in order to identify other orthopoxviruses being transmitted in human and animal populations, further research, including using molecular and genomic approaches, is needed. 11. conclusions in endemic and non-endemic countries alike, this outbreak of mpox has challenged economic, medical, and public health infrastructures all around the world. the impact of the virus on our lives will only be known in the future. moreover, zoonotic viruses and pathogens are likely to continue causing outbreaks of disease in the future. as a result, in addition to curbing this outbreak, efforts must focus on ensuring that comprehensive measures are devised to prevent future outbreaks of zoonotic origin.
monkeypox virus: who's second public health emergency of international concern within 2 years abstract an upsurge of monkeypox disease cases with clade i virus in central africa led who to declare a public health emergency of international concern for a second time shortly after the worldwide clade ii mpox epidemic in 2022/3 among homosexual men. in the democratic republic of congo, the annual incidence of clade i mpox, transmitted mostly from animal sources to children, increased 20‐fold between 1980 and 2007; 60,000 mpox cases occurred between 2010 and 2023. the incidence again doubled between 2023 and 2024, showing a case fatality rate of 3.3%. a new clade ib virus was detected in 2024 in eastern drc where mostly adults were infected by heterosexual contact. ib was recently introduced and showed a mutation spectrum of human‐to‐human transmission. asymptomatic mpox infections, the release of infectious virus before symptom onset in a subgroup of cases, and superspreaders complicate containment measures during the 2022 epidemic. isolation of cases until two consecutive negative pcr tests was recommended but necessitates cheap and rapid diagnostic tests which are in development. sexual behavioural changes during the 2022 epidemic have contributed more to the curbing of the epidemic than vaccination. the smallpox vaccine dryvax protected children exposed to clade i mpox in drc in the 1980s. the attenuated third‐generation smallpox modified vaccinia ankara vaccines and derivatives showed robust protection against clade iib mpox during the 2022/3 epidemic in various study formats. vaccine efficacy exceeding 75% was reported after two doses. mrna in lipid‐nanoparticle encoding surface proteins from extracellular enveloped and intracellular mature virions of monkeypox virus induced humoral and cellular immune responses that protected macaques against mpox disease with clade i and ii viruses better than mva. only mixtures of monoclonal antibodies protected mice from mpox. the antiviral tecovirimat showed no efficacy in two clinical trials against clade i and ii mpox. abstract the figure shows examples of zoonotic diseases and their affected populations. the red arrows indicate the path of monkeypox virus infections first from a wild animal reservoir as a zoonosis mostly to children in central and west africa, followed by the 2022/3 epidemic with human‐to‐human transmission in men having sex with men and in 2024 also with heterosexual transmission between humans. figure credit: this figure is excerpted from a us gao report gao‐12‐55: www.gao.gov/products/gao‐12‐55 biosurveillance: nonfederal capabilities should be considered in creating a national biosurveillance strategy. in the public domain. introduction the monkeypox virus was isolated in 1959 in copenhagen. it belongs to the orthopoxvirus genus of the poxviridae family. mpxv infections were subsequently reported in monkeys from zoos and in a monkey colony maintained in a us pharma company. these observations led to the name monkeypox virus. the name is, however, a misnomer. mpxv has a broad animal host range, and the natural reservoir of this virus is squirrels and rodents from africa. in the early 1970s, the first human monkeypox disease cases were reported in the democratic republic of congo and in west africa, they occurred mostly in children. the viruses differed genetically, which led to the distinction of clade i and clade ii mpxv. the infections represented small clusters associated with bushmeat eating and were characterised by high mortality. the orthopoxvirus genus includes veterinary pathogens such as cowpox, camelpox, horsepox and mousepox viruses, vaccinia virus of unknown origin as well as one of the most dreaded viruses of human history, variola virus which caused smallpox. to verify whether the world health organisation smallpox vaccination and eradication campaign had achieved its goal, smallpox‐like skin eruptions were intensively investigated in the 1970s. no smallpox cases and only a few mpox cases were detected when screening more than 6 million children from central and west africa for skin lesions. in the 1980s and 1990s, sporadic cases of clade i mpxv infections were reported in drc, suggesting that mpxv was endemic in central africa. the case fatality rate was particularly high in young children. in 2003, a small number of clade ii mpxv infections were observed in us citizens handling imported pet animals from africa. subsequently, mpxv infections developed a new dynamic, starting in 2017 with a clade ii mpxv epidemic in nigeria, which affected nearly 300 subjects. the patients were mostly young male adults. the situation changed again and dramatically in 2022 when a new form of clade ii west african mpxv got transmitted among males having sex with males. a worldwide epidemic largely limited to the gay population started with clade ii mpxv in may 2022 and rapidly reached peak numbers with more than 30,000 monthly cases in august 2022. most cases were observed in america and europe. in july 2022, who declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern. after public alerts and information campaigns among msm networks and about 100,000 mpox cases, case numbers dropped rapidly, and the pheic status of mpox was lifted in may 2023. literature references and more detail for these earlier phases of the mpox epidemic can be found in a previous lilliput review. an upsurge of mpox cases with clade i mpxv in drc and its spread to neighbouring countries led who to declare mpox again a pheic on 14 august 2024. in the 21st century, only ebola has twice been declared a pheic. what had happened that who declared mpxv a pheic for a second time within 2 years? the events leading to the second pheic alert for mpox in central drc, the annual incidence of mpox increased 20‐fold between the 1980s and 2007, from 0.5 to 11 per 10,000 population, respectively. in 2007, mpox showed a clear association with ecological conditions: the annual incidence was 11, 6 and 3 cases per 10,000 population for forested, mixed and savannah areas, respectively. the average age of mpox cases was 12 years. smallpox‐vaccinated persons had a fivefold lower risk of mpox as compared with unvaccinated persons, suggesting an 80% vaccine efficacy against mpox. the mpox incidence increase was attributed to the waning immunity of the smallpox vaccination campaign, which stopped in 1980. the mpox situation in drc subsequently aggravated. a large consortium led by belgian and congolese epidemiologists counted 60,000 clinically suspected mpox cases in drc between 2010 and 2023. during this time period, the annual incidence quadrupled from 2200 to 15,000 cases. children accounted for 65% of the cases. the overall cfr was 4.6% and even higher in young children. mpox had a focus in central drc, but spread over time into many other drc provinces. the disease was nearly exclusively limited to rural areas, with a dominance of rainforest over savanna areas, and it displayed a trend for yearly seasonality. when limiting the analysis to laboratory‐confirmed cases, a comparable temporal increase in mpox was observed. about 60% of the pcr tests confirmed an orthopoxvirus infection. within the orthopoxvirus‐negative samples, 40% tested positive for varicella zoster virus. while this observation indicates an overestimation of mpox, this effect is more than compensated for by under‐reporting of mpox from low health care‐seeking behaviour in remote rural areas. the situation in drc is still accelerating: when 15,000 suspected mpox cases were reported in 2023, the same number was already noted in the first half of 2024. imported clade i cases have been reported in sweden and thailand. a further warning signal was a changing epidemiological situation: clusters of clade i mpxv in drc were transmitted by sexual contact. while sexual transmission was the rule for mpxv during the 2022 worldwide epidemic, this epidemic was caused by a clade iib mpxv. clade i mpxv was until recently not known to be sexually transmitted. in the past, most clade i mpxv infections occurred in children from remote drc villages. the children likely contracted the disease primarily from rodents. in september 2023, an mpox case was reported in the south kivu region of eastern drc, where mpox was not observed in the past. until february 2024, a total of 241 further cases of mpox were reported in this region: 52% of the cases were young females, most of whom were sex workers. children constituted 15% of the cases. all patients showed a cutaneous rash; 59% had fever; 42% lymphadenopathy; and two died from mpox. mpxv genome analysis revealed a new clade i virus annotated as subclade ib. the analysis of the mutation pattern suggested human to human transmission and pointed to a recent origin of this mpxv subclade. the diagnostic mutation signal for human transmission was elevated tc>tt mutations driven by the human apolipoprotein b mrna‐editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide‐like 3 proteins, causing cytosine deamination in viral genomes. absence of this mutation pattern indicates lack of exposure to human apobec‐3 activity and therefore suggests circulation of these mpxv isolates outside of the human population, representing likely animal to human transmission events. apobec3 genes have expanded in primates. by causing hypermutation in the viral genome, apobec3 represents a host‐mediated antiviral mechanism. apobec3 signals have already been observed during the worldwide 2022/3 epidemic with clade iib viruses. the basic mpxv evolutionary rate in animals corresponds to 1 nucleotide change per 3 years. observing 42 nucleotide substitutions during the 2022/3 clade iib mpox epidemic is thus 28 times higher than expected for circulation in an animal reservoir and likely reflected human‐to‐human transmission for clade iib since 2016. mutations led during the worldwide clade iib epidemic to sub‐lineages a.1, b.1, and a.2. clinical and epidemiological traits were then explored in a prospective observational study from a hospital in south kivu. from 500 suspected mpox cases, 80% were laboratory‐confirmed mpxv infections; practically all belonged to subclade ib. adults accounted for the majority of cases; half of them were women, and only 20% of the patients were children. occupation‐wise, a quarter were male mine workers, and 13% were female sex workers. half of the adults reported transactional sex. most patients reported contact with suspected mpox cases, either sexually between adults or via close household contacts in children. contact of children with wild animals was rare. fatigue, malaise and myalgia were prodromal signs before the appearance of rash. genital rash accounted for half of the lesion counts; the median count was 40 lesions, much higher than in the 2022 clade iib worldwide mpox epidemic. lymphadenopathy was high in adults and fourfold lower in children. the median hospitalisation duration was 7 days; most cases were clinically mild or moderate. a third of the patients had moderate residual clinical signs 2 months after hospitalisation. however, two paediatric patients had died, and four out of six pregnant women lost the fetus due to a transplacental infection. a high rate of fetal mpox infection was also observed in a prior study from central drc. from 4 mpxv‐infected pregnant women, only one delivered a healthy baby; two had a miscarriage in the first trimester, and one had a macerated stillborn; the fetal tissues and the placenta showed high level mpxv replication. a review of the literature documented the outcome for 12 further pregnancies in mpxv‐infected mothers. six fetal deaths were reported, and six delivered a healthy child. the outcome for three breastfed babies from mpxv‐infected lactating mothers was documented; all babies were infected, and one baby died. another study with 226 suspected mpox cases from south kivu, investigated between october 2023 and february 2024, documented transmission mostly by heterosexual contact. homosexual contact accounted for only 4%. women represented 54% of the cases. these researchers noted a sequential change in mpox epidemiology over the last decades. from a zoonosis in people having wild animal contact, to limited human‐to‐human transmission in the early african phase, followed by a worldwide human‐to‐human transmission chain in msm to heterosexual mpox transmission in central africa. this sequence of events reminded the changing epidemiology seen with hiv infections. they warned that war and social unrest in eastern drc facilitated cross border infections and that the new infection has the potential for another global spread. in 2022, war in the kivu region induced 60,000 people from drc to cross to uganda. burundi and rwanda which reported each 2500 cases after the second who pheic declaration. mpox cases were also, for the first time, observed in north kivu province of drc in a displaced person camp mediated by a close social, but non‐sexual, contact. for the time period 2022 to october 2024, 45,600 mpox cases were observed in 12 african countries. mortality was high with 1500 deaths indicating a cfr of 3.3%. a 2.8‐ to 4.3‐fold increase in cases was observed over this time period for laboratory‐confirmed or clinically suspected mpox cases, respectively. drc was the most affected country. within drc, only four provinces provided high case numbers. no gender bias was seen, and half of the cases were in children. the most prevalent symptoms were cutaneous rash and fever. the current surge is caused mainly by clade ib mpxv against the background of ongoing clade ia transmission in central africa and clade iia in western africa. the authors asked for possible causes explaining the surge in mpox cases. one relevant factor was the young age of the population: 85% of the drc population is younger than 40 years and has thus not received the smallpox vaccination, which provides cross‐protection to mpox. war, conflict, displacement, and a fragile health system also contributed to the mpox surge. it is currently not clear whether the genetic differences between clade i and clade ii viruses or their distinct transmission mechanisms explain the nearly 100‐fold cfr difference between them. it should be noted that the cfr in drc was fivefold lower in laboratory‐confirmed than in clinically assessed mpox cases. furthermore, a cfr of 0.3% was reported for burundi, uganda, rwanda, and kenya, regions that were only recently affected by clade ib, raising the question of whether epidemiological factors such as malnutrition, social upheaval, and hiv co‐infection, and not clade‐specific viral traits, have a greater effect on cfr. a comparison with smallpox might be helpful when assessing the impact of mpox epidemics. an annual maximum of 5523 smallpox cases, leading to 710 deaths, was reported for drc in 1963 to who. this is in absolute terms lower than the mpox cases and deaths reported for drc in 2024 by clade i mpxv. however, cfr is higher for smallpox than for mpox. in contrast, by august 2024, the epidemic with clade iib sub‐lineage b1 caused 99,176 cases and 208 fatalities in 116 countries. the attack rate among unvaccinated subjects living in a house with a primary mpox case was 9% compared to 4.5% in a subject living in a neighbouring house, which is much lower than comparable rates seen in drc for smallpox, which ranged from 37% to 88%. viral genomics to differentiate mpox epidemics drc intensive sequencing of mpxv genomes has been done to assess the impact of viral traits versus epidemiological cofactors on disease severity and to differentiate distinct mpox epidemics, which might occur in parallel. in this vein, the viral genomes derived from 340 mpox patients were sequenced. the patients were seeking medical help in drc between 2018 and 2024. all sequences belonged to clade i mpxv as expected for mpox cases in central africa. notably, only 17 genomes from south kivu province, collected in 2024, belonged to clade ib and showed little diversity. the remainder belonged to clade ia, which showed a 10‐fold higher degree of genome diversity. five groups could be distinguished in clade ia viruses from drc. one was the most diverse and widespread and came from regions around the congo river, while others originated from the central province and the southern savannah areas, respectively. despite this geographical differentiation, co‐circulation of different clade ia groups was observed in several areas. in some districts, up to three different viral variants were detected at the same time. no particular apobec3 mutation enrichment signal was seen in clade ia viral genomes. this observation concurs with the traditional paradigm of zoonotic spillover events with limited human‐to‐human transmission. the genetic diversity between clade ia strains from drc suggests multiple interspecies transmission events, raising the question of the animal reservoirs from where mpxv infections entered the human population. in contrast, clade ib viruses were restricted to recent samples of low genetic diversity from the kivu province and showed a fivefold higher apobec3 mutation signal than clade ia, supporting the interpretation of a recent introduction from a single animal source, followed by human‐to‐human transmission chains. this conclusion concurs with two prior studies which reported genome sequences from a south kivu hospital that defined the new clade ib viruses. molecular clock analysis dated the common ancestor of the south kivu genomes to mid‐september 2023. when sequencing viral genomes from 11 mpox patients in the western kinshasa province, a co‐circulation of clade ia and clade ib strains was detected in the summer 2024. together with the spread of clade ib from south to north kivu and to adjacent eastern african countries, the detection of clade ib in the proximity of the international city of kinshasa represents a strong danger signal for a potential international spread of clade ib mpxv. republic of congo and central african republic genome sequences from 31 mpox patients of the republic of congo, situated to the west of drc, collected in early 2024, revealed exclusively clade ia viruses, separated into two subclusters. one cluster resembled viruses detected in the central african republic, situated to the north of drc. the other cluster corresponded to viruses currently circulating in drc and shared sequence identity in excess of 99.5% with them. as most mpox cases in car occurred at the northern edge of rainforests, transmissions from wild animals living in the rainforest were considered likely by the authors. political instability increased the frequency of contact with rainforest animals in that region. nigeria in contrast, 18 viral genomes recovered from nigeria in 2019 all belonged to the clade iib, more specifically to the sub‐lineage a. they were closely related to the viruses causing the 2017 outbreak in nigeria and to exported mpox cases detected in the us, uk, israel and singapore. however, they were distinct from clade iib viruses of lineage b1, which caused the worldwide mpox epidemic in 2022/3. phylogeny tree analysis implementing measures to control mpox outbreaks will require an in‐depth understanding of how the virus is transmitted. therefore, a survey analysing more than 10,000 mpxv genome sequences, collected from 64 countries between 1958 and 2024, presents an important basis to address this question. the resolution is somewhat limited by the fact that 97% of the sequences were derived from clade iib viruses of the b1 lineage of the 2022/3 epidemic. clade i viruses have mostly been isolated from the congo basin area; the earliest sequence was from 1970. when reconstructing a temporal phylogenetic tree, the most recent common ancestor of clade i was dated to 1917. as viruses from different geographical regions often did not cluster within the phylogenetic tree, multiple introductions of clade i into local populations were deduced. the recently emerged clade ib viruses spread beyond the congo basin, but also clade ia was detected elsewhere, for example in sudan in 2005. for clade i, 96% of the sequences were derived from human isolates, with rare sequences derived from chimpanzee, shrews and squirrels. in contrast, only 12% of clade iia sequences were from humans, while 60% were from chimpanzees, which are, however, a spillover host rather than a reservoir host for mpxv. also, the prairie dog isolate causing the 2003 infections in the us belongs to clade iia. the oldest clade iia isolate dates from 1958. clade iia was not any longer isolated after 2018. clade iib was first detected in nigeria in 2017 and continued to circulate in west africa by human‐to‐human transmission. it was then exported to other countries in europe, asia, north america and north africa, with sustained human transmission in the eastern mediterranean. from this clade, now called clade iib lineage a, a descendent clade iib lineage b.1 emerged in 2022 that caused the worldwide mpox outbreak. clade iib viruses exhibit a higher substitution rate than other orthopoxviruses and display a clear apobec‐3 mutation signal. clade iia shows similar mutational processes as clade ia viruses, lacked the apobec‐3 signal which suggests that they circulated outside of the human population. mpxv has a mutation rate that is 10‐fold higher than that of varv, the agent of smallpox, and approaches that of some rna viruses. chinese researchers investigated the spectrum of mutations in mpxv during the 2023 outbreak in shenzhen. they observed missense, synonymous and mutations in non‐coding regions. viral proteins involved in host modulation, surface exposure, dna replication and viral assembly were affected by mutations. spanish researchers noted that variation in short tandem repeats within the low‐complexity regions of the mpxv genomes was greater than that of single‐nucleotide polymorphisms and could affect the expression of several viral proteins. transmission characteristics and nonpharmaceutical interventions phylogeographic approaches while the epidemiology of the current clade ib mpox epidemic cannot be directly compared to that of clade iib.b1 of the worldwide epidemic, the wealth of sequence information for the latter is a valuable source for epidemiological insights into possible transmission mechanisms and therefore provides hints for efficient containment measures. a phylogeographic approach with more than 1000 iib.b1 sequences allowed several conclusions in that respect. the most recent common ancestor for the worldwide epidemic was traced to west europe in march 2022. a rapid early spread in western europe led to a high number of introductions into other global regions with more than 40 introduction events. there was strong evidence for viral circulation before detection of the epidemic in each global region. asymptomatic infections asymptomatic mpxv infections further complicated the epidemiological situation. in studies from drc during the 1980s, a ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic infection of 4:1 was seen in unvaccinated contacts of clade i mpox patients. asymptomatic infections were also observed in the clade ii mpox epidemic. among 224 men attending a belgian sexual health clinic in may 2022, four mpxv positive cases were detected; three had no mpox symptoms while being positive for mpxv in pcr tests. they yielded a replication‐competent mpxv of clade iib.b1 and seroconverted to mpxv. the authors concluded that testing and quarantining of individuals reporting symptoms may not suffice to contain an outbreak. this conclusion was confirmed by a study in 113 gay or bisexual men conducted between august and october 2022 in spain, mostly migrants from latin america. seven were mpxv positive in pcr tests, six showed no mpox symptoms, but three shed infectious virus. also, serological surveys conducted during the 2022 mpox epidemic suggested a substantial number of asymptomatic mpxv infections. among 400 subjects from new york, 60% of them were msm, 6% showed orthopoxvirus‐specific antibodies but reported no recent mpox symptoms and had not received smallpox or mpox vaccination. similarly, among 225 patients from sexual disease clinics in san francisco who had no prior poxvirus vaccination nor received an mpox diagnosis, 8% showed orthopoxvirus‐specific igg during the 2022 mpox epidemic. r values and superspreading when analysing transmission chains resulting from mpxv introduction events, paredes et al. identified a bimodal pattern. only a small number of introductions resulted in a sustained expansion of local transmissions where some individuals tended to contribute disproportionately to infection events, while two thirds contributed no new infections. clusters of identical sequences ranged from 1 to 120, the latter pointing to superspreading events. the authors of this study computed r
t, the time‐varying effective reproductive number of the virus, to be between 1.5 and 3 in the initial phase of the 2022 epidemic. already in september 2022, r
t had dropped to < 1. notably, r
t fell below 1 before 10% of the high‐risk us population developed immunity to mpxv by vaccination. the researchers concluded that rapid pathogen detection and concomitant behavioural change were likely sufficient to curb the 2022 epidemic spread. kinetics of viral release control measures also depend on the kinetics and the amount of virus released by mpox patients and the persistence of the virus in the environment. during the 2022 mpox epidemic, chinese researchers analysed viral positivity by qrt‐pcr in body and environmental samples from 139 mpox patients over a 3‐week period after disease onset. viral load was highest in skin lesions, peaked in the first disease week, but remained high into the third week. the next highest viral loads were detected in rectal samples while saliva samples were low and close to a viral load considered unlikely to transmit the disease. environmental samples taken around the mpox patients showed a considerable viral contamination that persisted over the observation period, particularly on the floor, bedside, and in air conditioning outlets. an mpxv‐specific antibody response developed in the first 2 weeks after symptom onset. in another chinese study, 39 mpox patients from the 2022 epidemic were analysed over a 3‐week period after hospitalisation. highest viral loads were again detected in skin lesions, followed by saliva samples. at discharge from hospital, 70% of the saliva samples and 85% of dry scabs were still virus‐positive; 23% of the dry scabs yielded an infectious virus upon culture. neutralising serum antibody titers increased over the hospitalisation period, and the titers were lower in mpox patients coinfected with hiv. a study from the uk which followed 11 clade ii mpox patients for longer than 3 months by both pcr and virus cultivation reported a median time of 12 days after symptom onset for infectious virus isolation. however, in hiv co‐infected patients, infectious mpxv was isolated for up to 103 days. the median ct value in pcr for which mpxv could still be isolated was 31. serial intervals dutch researchers analysed 109 paired infector‐infectee mpox cases during the 2022 epidemic. a total of 34 infectees reported a single potential infector. from these pairs, a serial interval of 10 days was deduced. presymptomatic transmission may have occurred in 5 of 18 pairs. the scientists deduced that transmission can occur from 4 days before to 8 days after symptom onset of the infector. us researchers calculated a serial interval of 8.5 days and an incubation period of 5.6 days. the dutch scientists estimated a reproduction number r of 1.3 to 1.6, using the average doubling time of 11–20 days during june 2022 and suggested that a suppression of 38% of secondary infections should be sufficient to push r below 1. reinfection rhesus macaques were experimentally infected with mpox. irrespective of whether infected intravenously, intradermally, or intrarectally, the animals developed both humoral antibody and cellular t cell immunity after demonstrating skin lesions and a marked viremia. one month later, when skin lesions had resolved, the macaques were again challenged intravenously with clade iib mpxv. no renewed skin lesions were observed, and only a small transient viremia was seen. the marked upregulation of innate immune cell signatures seen after primary infection was not observed after re‐challenge. upon re‐challenge, the animals showed, however, a rapid activation of an anamnestic t and b cell response. based on the share‐net international clinical network documenting mpox cases from the worldwide mpox epidemic, physicians identified reinfection in eight gay patients about 100 days after the first infection. symptom scores decreased from the first to the second infection, and the skin lesions resolved earlier in the second than in the first infection. this international consortium also identified breakthrough infections in 30 gay subjects about 200 days after they had received mva‐bn vaccination. breakthrough infections were characterised by few lesions. nonpharmaceutical interventions npi should thus have a realistic target as demonstrated by the rapid decline of the worldwide mpox epidemic after the summer 2022 before vaccination could have an impact on transmission. one important element was information on safer sex given to opinion leaders that was spread within well‐connected networks of msm circles. another classical npi is case isolation. current guidelines for mpox suggest quarantine of infected individuals for about 3 weeks. a modelling study analysed three types of rules for ending the isolation of patients with mpox. under a symptom‐based rule, patients remain isolated until resolution of their skin lesions, which occurs on average after 25 days. the researchers estimated that 9% of the patients might, under this strategy, still be infectious. under a fixed‐duration rule of 3 weeks isolation, 5% of patients might still be infectious, but many individuals will be unnecessarily isolated. a solution to this dilemma is a testing‐based strategy with daily testing and release from isolation after two consecutive negative pcr tests. such an approach necessitates rapid, reliable, and cheap diagnostic tests. formats have been designed but not yet industrially developed that allowed mpxv dna detection in clinical samples with a 2 min lysis protocol followed by a 10 min single‐step recombinase polymerase amplification ‐crispr/cas13a reaction in a vest‐pocket analysis device, suitable for a point‐of‐care setting. behavioural change behavioural changes in the msm network might have contributed to the rapid decline of the worldwide clade iib mpox epidemic. to assess the potential role of these changes in sexual interaction, researchers conducted in may 2023 a survey among about 17,000 msm subjects from 13 european and american countries. adaptation to their sexual behaviour was reported by half of the surveyed subjects. people in this subgroup reduced their number of sexual partners, avoided group sex, sex‐on‐premises venues and chemsex. subjects reporting concerns about contracting mpox were twofold more likely to adapt their sexual behaviour. subjects with vaccination or those having experienced mpox were less likely to adapt their sexual behaviour. mathematical modelling with data from the 2022 epidemic in the italian msm community indicated that the significant behavioural changes in the community led to a rapid reduction of the reproduction number, r value, from 1.5 to 0.6, sufficient to stop the epidemic. the model predicted that the depletion of susceptible individuals was not the primary driver of the decline of the epidemic. contact tracing might have prevented a doubling of cases during the initial phase of the epidemic. in contrast, ring tracing and ring vaccination was unlikely to stop the epidemic. however, vaccinating subjects with more than 10 sexual partners per year could reduce the r value to near 1 and prevent a resurgence of mpox. pharmaceutical interventions: active immunisation classical smallpox vaccines since 1840, smallpox vaccines were propagated in cattle; by 1880, the leading smallpox vaccine source was calf lymph. the first generation of modern smallpox vaccines was live, unattenuated vacv, grown in the skin of cows and sheep. a freeze‐dried dryvax vaccine was developed in the 1950s, which allowed maintenance of vaccines without refrigeration. it was administered with a bifurcated needle to the skin leaving a vaccination scar which served as evidence for a vaccine ‘take’. however, a third of the vaccinees developed side effects including, in rare cases, encephalitis and even deaths. the second generation of vacv vaccines was propagated on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated eggs or in cell culture. when tested in 45,000 children from indonesia, they had the same efficacy as the calf lymph vaccine but also the same side effects. acam2000 was developed from viral clones of the dryvax vaccine and was propagated in cell culture for mass production and is used as smallpox vaccine stockpiles in the us. the fda approved it in august 2024 also for the prevention of mpox. the modified vaccinia ankara strain is a third‐generation smallpox vaccine. a vacv strain from turkey underwent in munich more than 500 passages on chorioallantoic egg membranes, which resulted in the loss of 14% of the viral genome. mva cannot replicate in human cells. it was used in west germany in the final phase of the smallpox eradication campaign. mva‐bn was also propagated in cell culture. it is administered by subcutaneous or intradermal injection. it is safer than acam2000 and of comparable immunogenicity and has also been approved for use against mpox. another third‐generation vaccine is lc16m8 developed in japan by growth in cell culture and on chorioallantoic membranes. it contains the complete vaccinia genome except for a truncated viral membrane protein b5. it was approved in japan after testing in 50,000 children. early observations work conducted between 1980 and 1984 explored the efficacy of smallpox vaccination on the prevention of mpox in drc. overall, 2510 contacts of mpox patients were evaluated for the development of mpox. secondary mpox was seen in 10% of household contacts without vaccination scars compared to 1.5% in contacts with vaccination scars from prior dryvax vaccination, indicating the protective efficacy of this smallpox vaccine also against mpox. dryvax vaccination protected also against asymptomatic mpxv infections. modern vaccination trials with classical vacv in macaques immunised with either dryvax or mva and subsequently challenged with mpxv, both vaccines protected the animals against mpox disease symptoms, but dryvax suppressed viremia better than mva. however, when immunisation and challenge were shortened to a 4‐day interval, mva showed superior protection over dryvax, indicating a quicker onset of immune protection. mva‐bn vaccine was also given to 87 children exposed to mpox cases in england as a post‐exposure prophylaxis. none developed serious adverse effects or mpox disease. all children developed antibodies against mpxv antigens b6 and b2, and a robust t cell response to mva‐bn virus. british researchers evaluated mva‐bn vaccine effectiveness against laboratory‐confirmed symptomatic mpox in an msm cohort using a case‐coverage approach whereby vaccination rates among 363 cases were compared with population vaccination coverage. a single dose showed a vaccine efficacy of 78% against mpox during the 2022 epidemic in the uk. however, this efficacy was only achieved 14 days after immunisation; at earlier dates, no vaccine protection was observed. similar data were described for spain in a national retrospective cohort study. during the 2022 mpox epidemic, mva‐bn pre‐exposure immunisation was offered to subjects eligible to receive pre‐exposure prophylaxis for hiv infection. each day, individuals receiving a first dose of the vaccine were matched to an unvaccinated subject, resulting in 5660 pairs. no protective effect of mva‐bn was seen during the first week after immunisation, while a ve of 65% and 79% was observed after 1 and 2 weeks of immunisation, respectively. a case–control study was conducted in the us between august 2022 and march 2023 with 300 case patients and 600 age‐ and region‐matched controls; all subjects were msm. ve against mpox was 75% for one dose and 86% for two vaccine doses; no difference was seen between subcutaneous and intradermal administration of the vaccine. in september 2022, about 200,000 us citizens at risk of mpox had received two doses of the jynneos vaccine. subsequently, 9500 mpox cases in the msm group younger than 50 years were analysed by vaccination status. mpox incidence among unvaccinated persons was 9.6 and 7.4 times as high as that among persons who had received 2 and 1 jynneos vaccine doses, respectively. only mpox cases occurring 2 weeks after immunisation were counted. in another us study, 2200 mpox case patients were matched to 8300 control patients. overall, 25 case and 355 control patients had received a full course with two doses of jynneos vaccine, indicating a ve of 66% in this observational study. for subjects receiving only one vaccine dose, ve was only 36%. the vaccine was applied subcutaneously or intradermally. notably, intradermal injection needs only a fifth of the subcutaneous dose. another way of applying limited vaccine to a large high‐risk population is to use only one dose instead of the recommended two doses. this strategy was tested in israel with an observational retrospective study. about 2000 at‐risk subjects were identified in a health register; half of them were vaccinated with one dose of jynneos. overall, five of the vaccinated and 16 of the unvaccinated subjects experienced mpox after vaccination. ve was with 86% high, but the low number of mpox cases limits the study conclusion. a meta‐analysis of 33 vaccine studies conducted mostly with mva‐bn in gay and bisexual men during the 2022 worldwide epidemic indicated a ve of 76% for one and 82% for two vaccine doses. post‐exposure ve was only 20%, but more data are needed as well as data for non‐msm populations and clade i virus another meta‐analysis of vaccination trials with mva‐bn reporting ve against mpox and immunogenicity to vacv found a significant correlation between ve and vacv‐binding elisa antibody titers. a second dose increased the antibody titre tenfold over a one‐dose regime, but increased ve only moderately. delaying the time between the first and second dose increased the vacv‐specific antibody titre and prolonged the durability of protection. mrna vaccines efficient vacv‐based vaccines were thus available that also protected against mpox and stockpiles were maintained. however, these stocks were insufficient when meeting the needs of the worldwide mpox epidemic. therefore, the pioneers of the mrna vaccine producers against sars‐cov‐2 extended this platform to mpxv. they developed nucleoside‐modified mrna encoding the clade iib mpxv antigens a35 and b6, as well as m1 and h3. in mice, twice immunised with each mrna species individually or combined into a trivalent or quadrivalent mrna vaccine, all mrna vaccines induced a robust humoral and cellular immune response against the targeted antigen. the multivalent and the monovalent m1 mrna vaccines also induced robust neutralising antibody titers against mpxv and vacv. multivalent, but not a35 + b6 vaccines protected mice against challenge with clade iib and clade i mpxv. multivalent and monovalent mrna vaccines protected mice also against vacv challenge. multivalent mrna vaccines given in two 30 μg doses assured survival in macaques challenged by the intratracheal route with clade i mpxv. the mrna vaccine prevented lesion development and attenuated, but did not prevent viremia and weight loss. clinical evaluation of bnt166 is underway with a phase i/ii clinical trial. chinese researchers had chosen three mv proteins and two ev proteins for a pentavalent mrna vaccine. two intramuscular injections with 200 μg rna induced igg elisa antibody increases against all five proteins and a 100‐fold and 50‐fold nab increase to vacv and mpxv, respectively. significant antigen‐specific cd4+, but no cd8+ t cell responses were measured in vaccinated macaques. upon challenge of the monkeys with a circulating clade iib mpxv from china, the vaccinated animals showed decreased mpox skin lesions, suppressed viremia and no virus excretion, and reduced cytokine production when compared to control macaques. the researchers also explored the immune response to the pentavalent mrna vaccine in naïve and immunodeficient rhesus monkeys. immunodeficiency was induced by infection with simian immunodeficiency virus. a robust antibody and a somewhat reduced cd4+ t cell response against the mpxv antigens were observed in the siv‐infected compared to control rhesus monkeys. macaques were twice immunised with a mrna lipid‐nanoparticle vaccine containing four mpxv mrnas, with mva or with buffer as control. one month after the boost vaccination, the macaques were intravenously challenged with a lethal dose of clade i mpxv. both mrna and mva vaccinated macaques survived while 80% of the control animals died. the mrna vaccine also protected against morbidity while mva immunised macaques developed severe and grave disease which was, however, attenuated compared to control animals. morbidity was quantified by lesion counts, viral burden in blood and in the throat, weight development and disease duration. with all criteria, mrna achieved superior protection over mva vaccination. the mrna vaccine induced a higher clade i and ii mpxv nab titre than mva immunisation. the mrna vaccine also induced better fc‐functional activities than mva. cellular immune responses were not measured in this study. as the mrna vaccine also reduced the viral titre in throat swabs, one might even expect a vaccination effect on viral transmission and not only on disease prevention. a clinical trial is underway. another study in rhesus monkeys compared the efficacy of mva, acam2000 or ad35 vector–based vaccines, expressing l1/b5 or l1/b5/a27/a33 mpxv proteins, against an intravenous challenge with a high dose of clade iib mpxv. all vaccines provided protection, but to various degrees. acam2000 mediated complete protection, while mva and the adenovirus‐vectored vaccine only conferred incomplete protection. protection correlated with nab titers. passive immunisation a report from 2005 demonstrated that macaques which received an immunoglobulin preparation from recently vaccinated subjects were protected from lethal challenge with mpxv, but they still developed skin lesions, increasing in number with decreasing nab titers. no protection was achieved in this animal model with normal immunoglobulin preparations. another group developed monoclonal antibodies against the vacv b5 antigen, which displayed vacv neutralising activity and protected mice against a lethal challenge with vacv, but viral load was only moderately decreased compared to controls. us researchers developed 89 mabs from immune human subjects. half of them displayed in vitro neutralising activity and many were cross‐reactive against several orthopoxviruses, including mpxv. however, most individual mabs reduced viral plaque numbers by only 70%. it needed a mixture of six mabs to achieve a good in vivo protective activity in mice challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of vacv. prophylactic application of this mab mixture achieved a 106‐fold reduction of the virus load in lungs, and all treated mice survived. in immunodeficient mice, the mab mixture achieved a sterilising immunity and assured a 100% survival. a human subject vaccinated against smallpox yielded two mabs, which bound distinct epitopes on mpxv b6 protein. upon intraperitoneal injection, these two mabs protected vacv‐challenged mice against weight loss and modestly reduced lung titers by tenfold compared to controls. a combination of two mabs directed against protein d8 and a33 found on mv and ev, respectively, protected mice from mpxv‐induced mortality and morbidity when given up to 3 days after viral challenge. antivirals tecovirimat binds the peripheral membrane protein f13 of ev, which is conserved across orthopoxviruses. f13 elicits production of wrapped virions, an intermediate step of intracellular virus maturation. the antivirals cidofovir and brincidofovir target the dna polymerase of orthopoxviruses. these three drugs inhibited diverse mpxv isolates from the 2022 epidemic in cell culture at concentrations that were achieved after oral dosing in humans. in vitro inhibition was observed for clade ia, ib, iia and iib mpxvs. a few tecovirimat‐resistant mpxv mutants have been described in immunocompromised mpox patients that were treated for extended periods. however, these mutants were not seen in clade ib isolates and only with low frequency in clade iib isolates. macaques infected intravenously with a lethal dose of mpxv and treated at days 4 or 5 with tecovirimat showed 100% survival when treated with 3 mg drug/kg body weight. with further treatment delay to day 6 after viral inoculation, the survival rate dropped to 50%. five daily tecovirimat doses were associated with higher survival than three daily doses. the trial was conducted under fda's animal efficacy rule for the treatment of smallpox. in a safety evaluation with 452 human subjects treated twice daily for 14 days with 600 mg tecovirimat, adverse events were observed with similar frequency as in the placebo group. tecovirimat was approved by fda to treat smallpox and can be used for mpox under an expanded‐access investigational new drug protocol. in a us study, 13 patients with advanced hiv who experienced severe mpox were treated with an extended tecovirimat course. despite treatment, they experienced prolonged hospitalisation and high mortality. notably, half of the patients showed a viral mutation that may indicate tecovirimat resistance. in the us, tecovirimat was prescribed under ea‐ind for over 7100 patients with painful anogenital lesions during the 2022/3 mpox epidemic. for 1600 patients an outcome was documented, but since they were not part of a clinical trial, neither safety nor efficacy could be demonstrated. two recent controlled trials were conducted with tecovirimat. the stomp trial, which enrolled msm patients from four continents with clade ii mpxv infections during the worldwide mpox epidemic, was stopped for futility after 75% of the targeted patients were enrolled, and no treatment effect could be documented. the palm007 trial enrolled 600 children and adults with clade i mpox disease from drc. tecovirimat treatment had no effect on time to healing of skin lesions, virus levels in blood, skin lesions and importantly, no effect on mortality, which was 1.7% in both the treatment and placebo groups. not much evidence exists for the efficacy of other drugs against mpxv infection. brincidofovir showed a modest survival effect in prairie dogs intranasally challenged with a lethal dose of mpxv. when the drug was given before or together with the challenge virus, half of the animals survived; when given 1 day after infection, only 25% of the animals survived compared with 10% in the placebo group. otherwise, two cases of severe disseminated mpox infection in renal transplant recipients were successfully treated with brincidofovir. antiviral research against mpxv clearly needs new compounds targeting distinct viral proteins. german researchers conducted a multi‐omics analysis of the transcriptome, proteome, and phosphor‐proteome signatures of mpxv‐infected primary human fibroblasts to identify new targets. they identified perturbations of immune‐related pathways and changes in the dynamic phosphorylation of both host and viral proteins. these infection‐elicited molecular fingerprints identified nearly 700 drug targets. based on these insights, they selected 52 drugs. as a proof‐of‐concept drug target validation screen, they tested these drugs in cell culture for an attenuated mpxv cytopathic effect, for growth inhibition of a vacv reporter and for reduction in mpxv mrna accumulation. they identified two candidate antiviral compounds. interestingly, tecovirimat, while reducing the amount of released virus, did not inhibit intracellular viral mrna accumulation or cytopathic effects. political considerations the who's contingency fund for emergencies released us$ 1.45 million for fighting mpox, with more to come with the pheic declaration. commentators in a leading medical journal judged these funding levels insufficient to support a robust emergency response. the mpox continental preparedness and response plan for africa, co‐led by who and africa cdc, formulated 10 pillars of action. it pledged financial resources but for a timely implementation an increased african leadership is pivotal for success. likewise, when the who declared a second pheic for mpox, japan has pledged up to 3.6 million doses of its lc16m8 vaccine, and the european union agreed to distribute 200,000 doses while the us offered just 50,000 vaccine doses. however, even when taking japan's pledges at face value, this still falls short of the demand for 10 million vaccine doses expressed by the africa cdc. when resources are limited, decisions by local public health and political authorities are needed. model calculations showed that vaccinating 80% of all children younger than 5 years in endemic regions such as drc could lead to a 27% reduction in cases and a 43% reduction in deaths, but still require 10 million vaccine doses. some lessons from the covid‐19 pandemic have apparently not been learned. for example, african countries still lack the resources to track the disease, the facilities to make their own vaccines, and a regulatory infrastructure in the form of an african medicines agency. pheics are by definition a global threat to health that needs a coordinated response from leaders everywhere. a response includes the training of health workers, the organisation of genomic and epidemiological surveillance, conducting clinical trials, the development of diagnostic tools, and monitoring of animal reservoirs. much fewer viral genome sequences have been determined for clade i mpxv from africa than for clade ii in the northern hemisphere, which hampers the delineation of viral variants and the design of containment measures, which are most efficient when implemented within 100 days after an outbreak. after a pandemic such as covid‐19, people are all too eager to forget their painful experiences. psychologically, it might be understandable to suppress past pandemic experiences to maintain an optimistic view into the future. rationally, this is not a helpful attitude. not learning the lessons from a past painful experience and taking appropriate actions accordingly means risking living again the same painful experiences. denying scientific evidence is self‐harming. the covid‐19 pandemic has revealed not only a loss of rationality in substantial parts of our societies but also a flood of health misinformation and deliberate disinformation. as the lancet wrote, health misinformation was weaponised as propaganda, exploiting fear, undermining public trust, and hindering collective action in critical moments. it became a deliberate instrument to attack and discredit scientists and health professionals for political gains. while who encourages responsible communication and flags misleading content, social media such as meta has decided to drop fact checking. deliberate disinformation on both classical and social media is extensively and increasingly used by authoritarian regimes to subvert liberal democracies. to this attack comes now the downsizing of the very institutions we need for fighting the spread of epidemics by the current trump administration. the us withdrawal from who, the dismantling of usaid, the mass lay‐offs at cdc, the freezing of research money at nih, and the intention of the new us health secretary to instruct the nih to take ‘a break’ from infectious diseases, all these measures are serious blows for pandemic preparedness. while one might still understand the unwillingness of us taxpayers to support fragile and underfunded health systems run by african governments, which in addition foster epidemic spread by wars, such political decisions in affluent societies are shortsighted since epidemics do not know frontiers. even large oceans are no physical barriers to epidemic spread as dramatically seen for west nile virus epidemic, covid‐19, the 2022/3 mpox epidemic and the avian influenza epidemic, which all had major impacts in the us. sadly, the current us government follows chaotic decisions even when the interests of us citizens are at stake, as in the avian flu/dairy cattle epidemic ongoing in the us. usda must now try to rehire scientists for an avian flu response who were just fired to cut governmental costs. viral epidemics are increasing in frequency. this is now the worst moment to upset public health institutions such as cdc, which were the envy of the world. cdc websites were taken down and a prime source of public health information such as cdc's mmwr failed to appear for political pressure, which has not happened in 60 years. scientists and doctors must stem this erosion of public health and infectious diseases research in the us. the us government deliberately renounces being the leader of science in general and in infectious diseases research, in particular. european countries must try to fill this void created by the current us administration. the european countries have now realised that they must stand on their own feet and spend hundreds of billions of euros on defence. scientists in europe should lobby that defence does not only mean to withstand the military threat of dictatorial systems but that defence should also include protection of their populations from future pandemic threats. if a fraction of the planned defence budgets is taken to fight infectious diseases, a lot can be done and would also facilitate acceptance of the huge defence budgets by european peaceniks as well as stimulate the soft power of the eu. author contributions harald

comprehensive insights into monkeypox: recent advances in epidemiology, diagnostic approaches and therapeutic strategies abstract monkeypox is a viral infection closely related to smallpox, manifesting as a milder febrile rash in affected individuals. over the past two decades, the incidence of mpox has surged, possibly linked to a declining immunity against the smallpox vaccine worldwide. recent outbreaks of mpox in multiple countries have sparked concerns regarding altered transmission patterns and the potential for a global menace. in this article, we present a multidimensional review encompassing the latest scientific discoveries, illuminating the intricate structure of the human mpox virus. key findings include advancements in understanding the virus’s molecular mechanisms, which highlight its genetic adaptability and potential for zoonotic spillover. diagnostic innovations, such as improved molecular assays, have enhanced detection accuracy, while novel therapeutic strategies, including antiviral drugs and vaccines, show promise in mitigating outbreaks. our conclusions emphasize the importance of robust surveillance systems, vaccination programs, and rapid response strategies to curb mpox’s spread. future recommendations include strengthening global collaboration for zoonotic disease surveillance, advancing the research on host–pathogen interactions, and developing next-generation therapeutics to address this emerging public health threat effectively. 1. introduction monkeypox is a viral disease and an agent of the genus orthopoxvirus. the illness, which is primarily seen in central and west africa, is comparable to smallpox, which was declared extinct in 1980. as a zoonotic virus, the mpox virus most frequently infects humans through contact with rodents and primates that have the disease. fever, chilliness, enlarged lymph nodes, headache, back pain, muscle aches, and fatigue are some of the symptoms of mpox. a rash typically starts on the face before spreading to other body parts. mpox can occasionally result in serious disease and even death, especially in people with weakened immune systems. the world health organization has recommended adding mpox to its list of conditions that could cause a public health emergency of global concern. the disease was identified in humans for the first time in 1970, and periodic outbreaks have been noted. it is common in certain parts of central and west africa. uncertainty still exists over the extent of mpox transmission in africa, which may be underreported. in recent years, few cases of mpox have been documented in the united states and the united kingdom, most usually among travelers from the affected african nations. given that the mpox virus is a zoonotic disease, it is crucial that we understand the role that wildlife plays in its maintenance and dissemination. hence, to control and halt the spread of the illness, a study on the epidemiology, ecology, and monitoring of mpox is essential. this review aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of monkeypox by integrating recent advancements in molecular characterization, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic tools, and therapeutic strategies. it aims to offer valuable insights for virology research and public health measures to combat this emerging global health threat. 2. background and issues mpox was initially identified in research laboratory monkeys in 1958. the virus is frequently found in monkeys and rodents in central and west africa, where mpox has proven to be particularly dangerous in children, with death rates as high as 10% in severe outbreaks. additionally, infected ”exotic pets” such as enormous, pouched rats, brush-tailed porcupines, and rope squirrels have spread the mpox virus outside africa. the first mpox pandemic outside africa occurred in the united states of america in 2003, when a caged prairie dog in milwaukee, wisconsin transmitted the virus to a child. there were a few rare cases recorded in the uk, us, and singapore between 2018 and 2022; in each of them, the underlying index case was a person who had recently left nigeria. the mpox virus can infect humans by animal bites or via direct contact with contaminated human bodily fluids. it can also be spread from person to person by intimate contact, most typically amongst family members; exposure to respiratory droplets may also be a mechanism of transmission. the illness reveals itself in people two weeks after infection, with fever, headache, general malaise and tiredness, and swollen lymph nodes. a few days later, a rash of elevated pimples appears on the face and torso. they eventually crust and fall off, and the illness takes two to four weeks to run its course. outbreaks are kept under control by isolating patients and keeping the environment clean. to prevent infection, jynneos, an attenuated live virus vaccine, can be utilized. smallpox vaccination similarly provides some defense against the mpox virus; smallpox vaccine injection may help prevent persons who are at risk of being infected with the mpox virus, such as veterinarians and other animal workers. a more serious outbreak that included widespread human-to-human spread outside of africa started in 2022. in may 2022, the outbreak started in the uk and spread quickly in the months that followed, infecting countries in africa, asia, australia, and the americas. traditionally, mpox was considered a zoonotic disease. nevertheless, many of the reported cases in recent outbreaks have been linked to intimate and sexual contact, particularly among men who have sex with men. this pattern has raised concerns about mpox’s association with sexual health. although mpox is not classified as a sexually transmitted infection, evidence suggests that the virus can be present in bodily fluids, including semen, and transmission during close physical contact is likely. the clustering of cases within sexual networks has highlighted the need for targeted awareness campaigns and interventions within these communities. the sexual health aspect of mpox underscores the importance of reducing stigma, promoting accurate health messaging, and integrating mpox prevention efforts into existing sexual health services. addressing these challenges is crucial to controlling the outbreak and preventing future spread. the who declared the monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern in late july, after more than 18,600 cases were reported. in 1958, human mpox, which is connected to the smallpox virus, was discovered. the present epidemic in 2022 has been puzzling because there is no epidemiological link and there is a risk that the virus might be spread sexually. in addition, the morphological and pathogenetic mechanisms by which the virus enters host cells are poorly understood. however, a recent national multicenter study in spain analyzed the early phase of the 2022 mpox outbreak. it included 1472 confirmed cases, primarily affecting middle-aged cisgender men, with sexual exposure, especially among men who have sex with men, as the main transmission route. immunosuppression, mostly due to hiv, was observed in 40% of patients. common symptoms included rash, fever, and adenopathies. co-infections like syphilis, gonorrhea, and hiv was frequent. only 6.5% had prior orthopoxvirus vaccination. treatments were heterogeneous, with most receiving symptomatic care; 58 patients required hospitalization, and 1 died. this highlights the need for targeted public health interventions. this article seeks to summarize what is now known about this re-emerging virus and speed up the understanding of previously published research findings on the human mpox virus. 3. mpox virus classification the orthopoxvirus genus of the poxviridae family contains the mpox virus, poxviruses are enclosed big viruses; 200 kilobase pairs of double-stranded dna that are heavily loaded with 200 genes make up their genome. around half of the genes are well-evolved in vertebrate poxviruses and are required for viral replication, while the other half are referred to as “accessory” genes that are mostly involved in virus and host interactions and may not be necessary for viral replication independently. many poxviruses infect most invertebrates and vertebrates, affecting a wide range of veterinary and human disorders. the two subfamilies that make up the poxviridae family are entomopoxvirinae, which infects insects, and chordopoxvirinae, which infects vertebrates. one of the 11 genera that make up the subfamily chordopoxvirinae is opv. all opv species are categorized as zoonotic viruses since they all have animal reservoirs except the variola virus, which only affects humans. 4. mpox genetic clades and evolution experts in virology, evolutionary biology, and councils of research institutes from around the world reviewed the phylogeny and nomenclature of known and unknown mpox virus variations or clades. they discussed the characteristics and evolution of several mpox virus strains, differences in their apparent phylogenetic and clinical composition, and any potential repercussions for virological and evolutionary research, as well as public health in the future. the panel decided on new nomenclature for the virus clades that adheres to professional norms. they reached an agreement on the listing and categorization of virus clades on genomic sequence repository sites. in the proper naming system, the clade will be denoted by a roman number, and the subclades will be denoted by a lower-case alphanumeric character. hence, clade i, clade iia, and clade iib are included in the revised terminology, with clade iib denoting the collection of variants that were primarily in use during the global pandemic of 2022. lineages will be given the names that the experts have suggested as the pandemic progresses. if further time is required, the experts will convene. the new names for the clades should go into force immediately, while work on the names of the diseases and viruses continues. different strains of the monkeypox virus exhibit genetic polymorphism and genomic instability, contributing to strain evolution. mpxv is a dna virus that undergoes frequent mutations, enabling its rapid spread. the emergence of well-adapted variants can have devastating global consequences. minor genetic changes facilitate host adaptation, with moderate transmission rates being more common. genetic mutations, both stabilizing and destabilizing, enhance viral fitness and support interhuman transmission. different strains of mpxv exhibit variations in their genome sizes, ranging from 190,083 to 206,372 base pairs. these strains are classified into two clades: west african and congo basin. through epidemiological studies, researchers have observed differences in the severity of mpx infection in various regions. by comparing three west african strains with a central african strain, it was found that there is a nucleotide variance of approximately 0.55% to 0.56%. the primary distinctions between these strains lie in the orthologs of the br-203c, br-209, and cop-c3l genes. the br-203 gene, for instance, encodes a complete protein comprising 221 amino acids. curiously, the west african strain of mpxv encodes only a partial n-terminal fragment, consisting of approximately 51 amino acids, for the specific gene under investigation. intriguingly, this gene is an ortholog of the m-t4 gene that exists in the myxoma virus. the myxoma virus is notorious for causing myxomatosis, a disease affecting european rabbits. intriguingly, scientific studies have shown that deleting the m-t4 gene results in a heightened inflammatory response. this finding suggests that this gene regulates the immune response to viral infections. br-209 acts as an il-1β-binding protein, preventing the binding of il-1β to the il-1 receptor. the cytokine il-1, present in forms of the il-1α, il-1β, and il-1 receptor antagonist, affects the inflammatory response. one of these mechanisms involves the production of vil-1βbp. by binding to il-1β, vil-1βbp prevents il-1β from interacting with its cellular receptors, inhibiting its signaling and dampening the immune response. the cop-c3l gene in the vaccinia virus codes for a secreted protein called vaccinia virus cop. the central african strain of mpxv expresses a shorter protein known as the mpx inhibitor of complement enzymes, which is the ortholog of the cop-c3l gene. the variola virus, responsible for smallpox, contains the ortholog known as the smallpox inhibitor of complement enzymes. mpxv strains exhibit genetic diversity, with the congo basin clades being more severe and associated with human infections worldwide. understanding the roles of these genes in mpxv pathogenesis is essential for comprehending the complex interactions and their contributions to the virus’s disease-causing mechanisms. the 2022 outbreak of mpxv is associated with a divergent branch, referred to as lineage b.1, which is derived from lineage a.1. lineage a.1 has been associated with mpxv exports from nigeria to the united kingdom, israel, and singapore in 2018–2019. the 2022 mpxv outbreak may be attributed to the ongoing spread and evolution of the virus from the 2017–2018 nigeria outbreak. poxviruses, including mpxv, have a lower mutation rate compared to rna viruses. however, the 2022 mpxv shows a rapid divergence from the 2018 virus, suggesting a rapid adaptation to its host. apobec3 editing contributes to the mutation rate, with 90% of new nucleotide changes due to this process. recombination plays a crucial role in poxvirus evolution, with the first natural recombination event in mpxv. gene loss and amplification are important factors in mpxv’s evolution, with the west african clade having larger genomes and more gene content. monitoring non-synonymous mutations, genome ends, and gene content is crucial for understanding the evolutionary dynamics and possible adaptations of mpxv. the mpox virus’s development and transmission are influenced by point mutations in several proteins, leading to the multi-country outbreak in 2022. the virus originated from the mpxv/united states/2021/md virus and has evolved through ten common amino acid alterations. the b.1 viruses, which were transferred from nigeria between 2018 and 2019, have specific amino acid changes in 22 of the 26 proteins. the study also examined characteristics of codon use and host adaptability, revealing a bias in codon use in genes undergoing nucleotide alterations in the b.1 lineage. selection pressure, rather than mutation pressure, played a significant role in the evolution of genes expressing nucleotide mutations in the b.1 lineage. monitoring and analyzing the virus’s genetic alterations is crucial for improving our understanding of its behavior and guiding effective preventative and control efforts. 5. mpox epidemiology sub-saharan africa has possibly seen mpox for several thousands of years since humans initially contracted the virus via close contact with diseased animals. mpox was recognized as a distinct sickness after smallpox was eradicated in 1970 and it became clear that smallpox-like infections were still happening in rural areas. the mpox virus was first discovered in monkeys used for research in 1958 at state serum institutes in copenhagen, denmark, and africa. mpox has received attention as a disease of significant global public health concern since the outbreak of the first epidemic in the usa in 2003, which was linked with infected pet prairie dogs. it was assumed that the native prairie dogs housed with imported rodents from ghana in the western region of africa were the primary source of the outbreak because the bulk of the affected people became ill after interacting with pet prairie dogs. mpox has been connected to a rise in cases that began in the midwest of the us in the summer of 2003. mpox cases have been reported in several countries since 2003, with the worst epidemic occurring in nigeria in 2017. the centres for disease control and prevention had reported 5783 instances of mpox as of 1 july 2022, spread over 52 different nations. figure 1 shows the geographical distribution of the cases worldwide. currently, the western hemisphere and parts of europe are home to the majority of mpox cases. according to recent studies, the united kingdom has the most instances in all of europe. with a median age of 31 years, most cases reported of mpox currently involve people under the age of 40. this group only emerged after the smallpox vaccination campaign had been abandoned, further illuminating the lack of cross-protective immunity. according to the external situation report issued on 10 june 2023, the world health organization received reports of 87,929 laboratory-confirmed cases of mpox from 111 countries across all six who regions between 1 january 2022, and 5 june 2023. this totals 146 deaths. since the last situation update, 552 new cases and 6 new fatalities have been reported. the number of new cases worldwide fell somewhat in the most recent reporting week. the americas have recorded the most cases in the last three weeks. cases have increased in several countries, including cameroon. europe and south-east asia have also reported additional cases, but with some delay. the number of cases in africa has dramatically grown, exceeding the previously recorded average. as of 5 june 2023, 15 nations had confirmed new cases within the maximum illness incubation time. the united states, brazil, and spain are among the countries with the most cumulative instances. these 10 countries account for 83.9% of all instances globally. since 1 january 2024, 13 african countries have reported mpox outbreaks, with a total of 18,737 cases, including 3101 confirmed and 16,636 suspected cases. the outbreak has resulted in 541 deaths, leading to a case fatality ratio of 2.89%. the affected countries include burundi, cameroon, the central african republic, the republic of the congo, côte d’ivoire, the democratic republic of the congo, ghana, kenya, liberia, nigeria, rwanda, south africa, and uganda. on 15 august 2024, sweden confirmed its first case of mpox clade i, with the infection traced to a region in africa experiencing a significant outbreak of this variant. this case marked the first recorded instance of clade i mpox outside of africa. as of 16 august 2024, the democratic republic of the congo has reported a total of 16,794 mpox cases, including 2860 confirmed and 14,934 suspected cases, with 535 fatalities, resulting in a case fatality ratio of 3.19%. the outbreak has spread across all 26 provinces, predominantly affecting males and children under 15 years of age. the persistence of widespread transmission emphasizes the need for targeted interventions, particularly in vulnerable groups and high-risk regions. burundi officially declared a mpox outbreak on 25 july 2024. by 16 august 2024, the country had reported 399 cases, comprising 100 confirmed and 299 suspected cases, with no fatalities. the mpox clade ib variant was identified in confirmed cases. among those affected, 55% were males, and children under five years old made up 38% of the confirmed cases. the outbreak has spread to 23 out of the 49 districts, highlighting the need for focused public health measures and surveillance. by 16 august 2024, a total of 263 cases had been reported in the central african republic, including 40 confirmed and 223 suspected cases, with no deaths. the outbreak affected six out of the country’s seven health regions, with 62% of cases occurring in males. additionally, a significant proportion of cases were among children under five years of age, indicating the virus’s impact on vulnerable populations. rwanda declared its first mpox outbreak on 27 july 2024. as of 19 august 2024, the country had reported four confirmed cases with no associated deaths. this marks the first occurrence of mpox transmission in rwanda, prompting health authorities to implement response measures to contain the spread and prevent further cases. as of 16 august 2024, nigeria’s ministry of health reported nine confirmed mpox cases with no deaths. the outbreak affected six of the country’s seven health regions, with the majority of cases occurring in males. additionally, 38% of the cases involved children under the age of 10, indicating a significant impact on young populations. the monkeypox outbreak continues, with low levels of transmission in europe and the americas, a minor decline in the western pacific, and an increase in cases in south-east asia. the number of cases has recently increased in africa, where transmission is more constant. most patients are men, and the age distribution is consistent. children make up a minor fraction of cases, with the majority being recorded in the americas region. transmission occurs largely among homosexual, bisexual, and other males who have intercourse with other men. the predominant mechanism of transmission is through skin and mucosal contact during sex, followed by non-sexual contact between people. the most typically reported exposure contexts are parties involving sexual interaction; however, this is changing with time. rash, fever, systemic rash, and vaginal rash are all common symptoms. however, reliable information on transmission and exposure settings is scarce in the who african region, making it difficult to gain thorough knowledge of the virus’s spread there. 6. viral re-emergence of mpox on 18 may 2022, portugal, spain, and canada reported 14, 7, and 13 cases of mpv infection, respectively. on 19 may 2022, belgium, sweden, and italy confirmed their first mpv instances. on 20 may, australia reported two incidents. on 20 may 2022, france, and germany, as well as the netherlands all reported their first cases. on 20 may, the uk’s health secretary revealed an additional 11 mpv cases, bringing the total to 71. the first nation to impose a 21-day mpv quarantine requirement was belgium. on 21 may 2022, israel and switzerland both verified their initial instances. on 18 may 2022, spain confirmed the very first case. the republic of spain reportedly reported a spike in cases, at 20, on 3 june, bringing the overall number of cases to 186. denmark’s first incidence was reported on 23 may. this was said to be a visitor who had just arrived from the canary islands. on 24 may 2022, quebec in canada reported the confirmation of 15 instances; the same day, the czech republic also announced the confirmation of one case. in belgium, the putative offender attended a concert event. the country’s first confirmed case was a 29-year-old tourist from west africa who visited the united arab emirates at the end of may. slovenia also verified its initial incident. we found that 73 nations reported mpv cases as of 1 january 2024. the origin of the present mpv outbreak, nevertheless, is yet unknown. according to the mpv’s changing nature, it may be transmitted from person to person or from animal to person. travelers from the endemic areas of africa to north america and europe were the ones who initially contracted the illnesses, which subsequently spread. the resurgence of mpox has led to debate, with declining immunity being a major theory. the theory is that waning immunity from previous smallpox vaccinations, which conferred some cross-immunity to mpxv, contributed to the rise in mpox cases. in the 1980s, the cessation of widespread smallpox vaccination made the population more susceptible to mpox, leading to selection pressure on the virus. this selection pressure may have triggered the development of mechanisms to bypass the immune system in mpxv, increasing the transmissibility of the virus. a second theory suggests that nonsynonymous mutations, particularly in coding regions associated with host recognition elements, may facilitate virus adaptation and fitness. these mutations could help the virus evade host immune responses and increase its transmission potential. because of its affiliation with this phylogenetic branch, the emergence of specific mutations in the genomes of lineage b.1 mpxv compared with related viruses has attracted considerable attention in 2018–2019. these mutations suggest accelerated microevolutionary processes that could lead to an increase in human-to-human transmission. the b.1 mpxv lineage responsible for the current pandemic on the european continent probably first appeared in march 2022. this finding suggests that the b.1 lineage evolved and spread in europe, resulting in the first mpxv cases that later spread to other continents, such as oceania and the americas. recent analyses also indicate that mpxv has adapted more rapidly in the last two years, suggesting an accelerated process of host adaptation. these results provide evidence for the adaptability of mpxv and its dynamics in human populations. the proposed theories offer possible explanations for the resurgence of mpox cases and highlight the importance of monitoring and understanding the evolution of the virus and transmission patterns to support public health. 7. mpox virus transmission the mpox virus spreads to and between humans when a person comes into proximity to an infected animal, individual, or objects that are contaminated. in addition to moving in large airborne droplets that invade the body via the mouth, eyes, or nose, the virus can also enter via damaged skin. for efficient human-to-human transmission, continuous contact is essential since these droplets are dense and seldom move more than a few feet. as an outcome, healthcare personnel and those who live in the same household as an infected person are more vulnerable. among the 2022 outbreak, mpox cases have indeed been concentrated in males who have had sex with men. although infectious mpxv has been found in sperm, mpxv dna has recently been detected in urine, feces, rectal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, and saliva. however, it is unknown whether the virus may infect sperm cells and reproduce in the genital canal. it is still unknown and under inquiry whether mpox may be spread especially via sexual transmission methods. in any case, many are speculating if the virus has mutated to make easier human-to-human transmission possible, similar to sars-cov-2, in light of this pattern of transmission and the emergence of mpox in non-endemic locations. mpox is less likely to inherit changes that speed up its spread since it is a dna virus, which can detect and correct mutations effectively than rna viruses such as sars-cov-2. 8. mpox virus morphology the mpox virus, along with other poxviruses, is one of the biggest and most complicated illnesses. the mpox virus is large enough to be visible under a fluorescence microscope and has an ultrastructure that can be viewed under an electron microscope. these are brick-like particles with widths ranging from 140 nm to 260 nm with an average particle size of 220 nm to 450 nm. hence, to differentiate the ultrastructure, the stronger amplification afforded by electron microscopy is required. the core, lateral bodies, outer membrane, and outer lipoprotein envelope are the four basic components of the orthopox virion. the center core, encircled by a dense layer of rod-shaped structures known as the palisade layer, contains the viral double-stranded dna and core fibrils. the palisade layer, lateral bodies, and central core are enclosed by the outer membrane, which is composed of many surface tubules. in contrast to virions released by cellular rupture, spontaneously generated virions typically contain the outer lipoprotein membrane. a mature virion seems to have around 80 viral proteins. 9. mpox virus genome one of the largest viral genomes, the mpox genome is a gigantic 197 kb single linear dsdna molecule. a collection of brief tandem repeats, terminal hairpin loops, and identical but oppositely oriented terminal reads of around 6 kbp are present at every end of the genome. about 190 non-overlapping open-reading frames, each containing 60 or perhaps more amino acid residues, make up the genome. the inverted terminal repeats exhibit 4 of these 190. mpox virus dna contains only around 31.1% guanine and cytosine. mpox virus has two separate genetic clades, the west african clade as well as the central african clade. it consists of inverted terminal repeats of 10 kb at either end. genes are densely packed; intergenic areas longer than 100 bp are uncommon. the center conserved area contains genes that perform” housekeeping” functions like transcription, replication, and virion assembly. the genes expressed in the terminal sections of poxviruses differ from one another and encode proteins implicated in the host range and pathogenicity. deep sequencing technology advancements have offered important insights into the standing nucleotide variation inherent in poxvirus populations. these variants were previously unappreciated but are now recognized as major contributors to poxvirus evolution. furthermore, there is increasing knowledge of the role that genomic architectural alterations play in determining poxvirus evolution. key drivers of genomic architectural alterations in poxviruses have been identified as homologous and non-homologous recombination, gene duplications, gene loss, and horizontal gene transfer. a recent study found a higher-than-expected incidence of snv accumulation in recent samples of mpxv. seven snvs have been seen since the initial epidemic in march 2022, with a total of fifty snvs discovered since 2018. the increased rate of snv acquisition in recent mpxv isolates may be due to the host adaptability, effective population size, and selection coefficient. selective sweeps or bottlenecks within individuals or during transmission may limit the accumulated diversity, leading to disparities between epidemiological isolates and phylogenetic data. the intergenic region of mpxv has been observed to expand or decrease, with varying clades having varying itr lengths. variants in the z-encoding region of the virus, such as the e3l gene, have been found, potentially affecting pkr. microsatellite variants, particularly the a26 ortholog, contribute to genetic variability and influence virus–host interactions. overall, the data highlight the complexities of poxvirus evolution and the various pathways involved in producing genetic variation within poxvirus populations. 10. mpox virus replication cycle poxvirus replication is distinct from that of other dna viruses in that it occurs in the cytoplasm of the host cell. poxviruses enter cells by an intricate mechanism that includes an attachment, hemi fusion, and core penetration within the plasma membrane, or via endocytosis. the specific method that poxviruses employ to enter cells is determined by their infectious form, which may either be a mature virion through one outer membrane or an extracellular enveloped virion with a different protein composition. in the ev form, the membrane that is particularly ev-specific is eliminated, preserving the underlying membrane affixed to the cell. ev is more specialized for cell-to-cell transmission despite mv’s greater prevalence because of its long, mobile projections made by the polymerization of actin which adheres to the cell’s surface. when a mature virion enters a cell, it loses its protective coating. once within the cell’s cytoplasm, the virus releases ready-made enzymes and certain other enzymatic components that weaken the cell’s defenses and start the synthesis of its original genes. then, the early messenger rna is made via the viral dna-dependent polymerase. the uncoating process that follows dna replication and the creation of intermediary transcriptional regulators are both supported by early mrna translation. the intermediate mrna is then translated and expressed in late mrnas, where it is converted into structural and non-structural proteins. then, translated proteins and dna concatemers generated during the initial stages of replication are assembled. they then transform, becoming immature virions, which mature into intracellular viruses. since imvs are devoid of an outer membrane, they can only spread when cells are damaged. intracellular enveloped virions are formed from imv particles that do not wrap completely in the cytoplasmic protein matrix. these cells are aided in reaching the cell membrane by microtubules. they then combine with the cell membrane to generate cell-associated viruses, that lead to actin polymerization and the production of filaments, which help to facilitate cev evacuation from the cell. both extracellular and intracellular viral pathogens have a significant impact on pathogenesis. the primary means of disease transmission from one cell to the next are intracellular viral virions, together with cevs. eevs are necessary for viral spread within an affected organism. 11. signs and symptoms of mpox viral infection mpox is a self-limiting condition that typically disappears in two to four weeks. the three distinct stages of a less severe form of smallpox include incubation, prodrome, and rash, which are either indicators or symptoms of mpv infection. on average, the incubation phase lasts between seven and fourteen days. fever and lymphadenopathy are common during the prodrome phase, with the latter characterizing mpox as opposed to smallpox and chickenpox1. compared to many other illnesses, such as the flu, mpox does not initially present with any noteworthy symptoms. in addition to other symptoms, patients may also have a fever, headache, muscular pains, and enlarged lymph nodes. a rash forms after a few days, first appearing on the face before moving to other parts of the body. the rash develops in a specific manner, beginning as a macular rash and continuing through popular, vesicular, and pustular phases before crusting over and flaking off. the rash often affects the face, trunk, and limbs, but it may also affect other parts of the body, such as the genitalia. mpox symptoms are comparable to smallpox symptoms while being less severe, and most patients recover completely. with a mortality rate between 1 and 10%, mpox can be risky. how severe the infection is will depend on many factors, including the virus strain, the accessibility of medical care, the level of exposure, and the patient’s condition. mpxv enters the body and replicates, spreading to lymph nodes, causing primary and secondary viremia. the virus primarily affects the skin, causing rash development, oral mucous membranes, genitalia, and conjunctivae. anogenital lesions, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy are common symptoms. mpxv can also affect the respiratory system, leading to severe breathing difficulties, pneumonia, and lung inflammation. pulmonary surfactants and lubricants can aid lung function. oral cavity lesions, such as glossitis, stomatitis, and gingivitis, can spread. lymphadenopathy is a distinguishing characteristic of mpx, manifesting as lymph node enlargement during primary and secondary viremia. mpxv causes relatively few liver lesions, but viral antigens can disseminate throughout the liver, leading to hepatocyte degeneration and liver lesions. a recent journal paper reports the clinical presentation of the first recorded case of mpxv, sars-cov-2, and hiv-1 co-infection. mpox and covid-19 are both airborne viruses that cause symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, headache, sore throat, and exhaustion. this case study’s subject was a 36-year-old man who developed symptoms after visiting spain. the patient tested positive for sars-cov-2 and had skin lesions similar to mpox. co-infection with mpxv, sars-cov-2, and hiv- 1 was verified by diagnostic testing. the case illustrates the overlapping symptoms of mpox and covid-19, emphasizing the significance of collecting a complete history and considering sexual behaviors for a correct diagnosis. sexual contact appears to be a significant mechanism of transmission for mpox, necessitating extensive sti screening. because the patient’s hiv-1 status indicates recent infection, care should be maintained even after clinical remission. because there is presently no widely approved therapy or prevention for mpox, healthcare systems must be aware of the likelihood of co-infections and advocate adequate diagnostic testing in high-risk people. 12. sampling and diagnosis of mpox virus the pcr test is crucial for detecting the mpxv in suspected cases. samples should be collected from exposed lesions, vesicles, or ulcers, with pharyngeal swabs taken if throat lesions are present. proper labeling is essential in order to avoid processing errors. healthcare workers must wear personal protective equipment, including droplet, contact, and eye protection, during diagnostic procedures to ensure safety. for high-risk cases without visible lesions, throat swabs may be used, with continued symptom monitoring if results are negative. samples should be transported to local or advanced laboratories for mpxv testing, alongside tests for other infections like hsv or syphilis. follow-up testing for confirmed cases includes lesion and throat swabs, blood samples in edta tubes, and urine samples, all stored in appropriate mediums. these measures provide valuable insights into disease progression and inform decisions on transitioning patients from isolation to inpatient care. accurate diagnostic testing for mpox requires proper sampling and storage techniques. specimens should be placed in sterile, leak-proof containers suitable for shipping under refrigerated or frozen conditions. dry swabs, lesion crusts, and swabs in a viral transport medium can be tested within 7 days if refrigerated, or within 30–60 days if frozen, depending on the specimen type. for shipping, specimens must be categorized as biological substances, bagged individually to prevent rejection due to leaks, and transported on dry ice to maintain the required temperature. packaging must ensure structural integrity and allow for gas release from dry ice. only trained personnel should handle hazardous shipments, which must be labeled with all necessary identifiers and contact details. these protocols are critical for safely transporting mpox samples linked to clade ii for laboratory testing. diagnostic results must be correlated with clinical and epidemiological data to confirm mpox infection. following these guidelines ensures specimen integrity and accurate testing. to further confirm mpox virus infection, diagnostic tests, and clinical and epidemiological data must be correlated. the diagnosis of mpox virus infection is based on clinical signs, laboratory tests, and medical history. by checking for lymphadenopathy at the prodromal stage of the illness, it is possible to clinically distinguish mpox from chickenpox or smallpox. the specimen samples are collected and forwarded to the lab to verify the diagnosis in compliance with the who criteria. pcr is the most widely used laboratory diagnostic method to identify mpox due to its accuracy and sensitivity. the fluid that is produced by vesicles and pustules, as well as dry crusts are the best samples to use in the diagnosis of mpox. when a lesion sample needs to be kept cool and kept in a dry, sterile tube without a viral transport medium, a biopsy appears to be an alternative in some circumstances. pcr blood tests are often inconclusive and should not be routinely obtained from patients because viremia typically lasts for a short period compared to the time the material is taken after symptoms start. the recommended specimen type for diagnosing mpox is skin lesion material, including swabs of lesion exudate, roofs from multiple lesions, or lesion crusts. testing should be offered to individuals meeting the suspected case definition, considering both clinical and epidemiological factors. it can be challenging to differentiate mpox based solely on clinical presentation, and other potential causes of skin lesions should be considered. safety procedures, including proper personal protective equipment and handling of specimens, must be followed. the collection and storage of specimens, including skin lesion material and additional types for research purposes, are needed. nucleic acid amplification testing, particularly polymerase chain reaction, is recommended for confirming mpox infection. reagents, controls, waste disposal, and biosafety measures should be appropriately managed during testing. serological testing and genetic sequencing are additional tools for diagnosis and surveillance. overall, the adherence to biosafety measures and risk assessments are crucial in handling specimens and conducting laboratory testing for mpox. for the confirmation of mpxv infection, clinical and epidemiological data should be considered. positive detection using an orthopoxvirus polymerase chain reaction assay, followed by mpxv confirmation via pcr and/or sequencing, or, in suspected cases, positive detection using an mpxv-specific pcr, confirms mpxv infection. although mpxv-specific confirmatory testing is preferred, a positive opxv pcr assay result is sufficient for laboratory confirmation. in instances where the clinical presentation and epidemiology indicate mpxv infection despite negative pcr results, serological testing can be utilized to investigate a prior infection. false-negative results can be influenced by factors such as specimen quality, handling, transportation, and technical issues. genetic sequence data, obtained through sequencing positive mpxv specimens, can provide valuable information on the virus’s origins, epidemiology, and characteristics. the who encourages countries and laboratories to share gsd, including raw data, through public access databases to enhance understanding and collaboration. sequencing can be performed using sanger or next-generation sequencing methods. laboratories must adhere to national reporting regulations. positive or negative test findings should be immediately reported to national authorities. states parties to the ihr are reminded of their responsibility to communicate relevant public health information with the who for occurrences that they have notified the who. access to the quick and reliable laboratory testing of samples from cases under investigation is critical for diagnosing and monitoring this developing virus. all nations should have access to reliable testing, either locally or by referral to laboratories in other countries willing and capable of diagnosing opxv or mpxv. the who’s regional offices can help member states gain access to testing through referral. the inactivation of samples at a local laboratory, where suitable and securely conducted, may improve referral and alleviate logistical issues. countries are invited to exchange their sequencing data so that the present outbreak can be better understood. 13. mpxv and mechanisms of immune evasion mpxv has sequence similarities with the vaccinia virus and uses a variety of strategies to avoid detection by the immune system. the mpxv f3 protein and the vacv e3 protein are homologous, indicating a possible functional relationship. mpxv suppresses the antiviral immune response more effectively than a vacv mutant missing the n-terminal region of its e3 homolog. this suggests that mpxv may prevent symptoms caused by its e3 homolog’s lack of the n-terminal region. mpxv cannot downregulate mhc class i; instead, it employs a method to prevent cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell activation upon interaction with mpxv-infected cells. by suppressing local t-cell responses, mpxv can evade the immune system while maintaining a viral reservoir. mpxv-encoded immunomodulators play a critical role in blocking antiviral t-cell responses, which are activated by the host. neutralizing antibodies are crucial for the protection against severe mpxv infections, while memory t-cells alone do not provide sufficient protection. the spread of mpxv relies on interactions with circulating monocytes, which may protect the virus from humoral immune responses. macrophages and other immune cells may also aid in the spread of mpxv. understanding the immune evasion mechanisms of mpxv and the interactions between various orthopoxviruses, such as vacv, is important for studying immunity to mpox and developing effective preventive measures like vaccinations. 14. treatment for mpox fortunately, the clinical course of mpox infections is usually mild and self-limiting. as a result, it infrequently justifies specialized therapy, and, instead, treatment is typically supportive. supportive therapy includes things like analgesics for pain, antipyretics for fever, and antibiotics for subsequent bacterial infections. yet, some people could require a certain kind of treatment. for those with serious illnesses, immunocompromised people, pregnant women, and youngsters, specific therapies can be required. the treatment and immunizations created to combat smallpox have shown some success against the mpox virus because of the similarities between mpox and smallpox. there is, however, little evidence to support this claim. mpox disease is not curable; however, research on treating smallpox indicates that vaccinia vaccinations, tecovirimat, vaccinia immune globulin, and cidofovir might be beneficial. cidofovir is an antiviral drug that inhibits the viral dna polymerase and exerts antiviral activity against a variety of viruses. it is usually administered intravenously with fluid administration and probenecid. although cidofovir has the potential to cause nephrotoxicity, a modified version called cmx-001 has been developed that is not nephrotoxic. in addition, cmx-001 exhibits antiviral activity against numerous orthopoxvirus species. st-246 is an agent that is administered orally and targets the intracellular release of the virus. it has shown promising results against several orthopoxviruses, including the variola virus that causes smallpox. by inhibiting the release of viral particles from infected cells, st-246 helps to contain the spread of infection. the european medicines agency authorized the usage of tecovirimat for treating measles in 2022, reported by the world health organization. it was first created as a smallpox remedy. because tecovirimat is currently not widely available, any usage of it needs to be carefully supervised. by blocking the viral dna polymerase, cidofovir has antiviral efficacy against some viruses. it has been observed that tecovirimat is particularly sensitive to several orthopoxviruses, including variola, cowpox, vaccinia, rabbitpox, ectromelia, and mpox. for the treatment of mpox, tecovirimat, an oral inhibitor of intracellular viral release, may be beneficial. these antiviral agents have been studied in various combinations, such as with vaccinia immunoglobulin, which is used to treat serious adverse events associated with smallpox vaccination clinical trials. the combination of these drugs has the potential to effectively treat orthopoxvirus infections. notwithstanding the recommended course of treatment, supportive and symptomatic therapy is the backbone of treating a mpox virus infection. it is crucial to realize that the only established treatment for mpox is treating symptoms and preventing complications. given the outbreak of mpox in 2022 and the current mpox cases worldwide, more research must be carried out before any treatment or vaccine can be created. to prevent infection with the mpox virus, certain precautions can be taken. this includes, but is not limited to, the following: consciously avoiding encounters with animals suspected to be mpox virus carriers, especially in regions where the mpox virus is prevalent; placing ill people in a room with negative pressure to prevent the virus from spreading from one person to another; isolating and euthanizing the animals suspected to be the virus reservoirs; avoiding contact with any objects that have come into contact with ill animals or people; and avoiding contact with ill people. frontline personnel caring for mpox virus-infected patients and other high-risk individuals who are expected to interact with infected individuals should wear the appropriate personal protective equipment designed to protect against airborne infectious agents, such as n-95 masks, fully covered water-resistant gowns, and double-layered gloves. 15. vaccination/prevention of mpox research has shown that smallpox vaccination offers a reliable defense against illnesses caused by mpox and other orthopoxviruses. when administered early in the incubation phase, it can postpone the start of the disease or minimize the severity of the illness. however, patients who have impaired immune systems face the risk of suffering serious side effects. mpox has become more prevalent since smallpox was eradicated in 1980 as a result of the end of immunization initiatives to prevent viral illnesses. several vaccines are available for preventing mpox, each with distinct mechanisms and efficacy levels, playing a critical role in responding to recent outbreaks, particularly in non-endemic regions in 2022. jynneos is a non-replicating modified vaccinia ankara vaccine developed by bavarian nordic. widely used for preventing smallpox and mpox, especially in high-risk populations, it has demonstrated safety and efficacy in clinical trials. strong immune responses have been observed in healthy adults and individuals with hiv. approved by the fda for adults, jynneos has shown excellent outcomes in preventing severe disease among healthcare workers and close contacts of infected individuals. its safety profile, particularly for immunocompromised individuals, and its availability in countries like the u.s., canada, and the eu make it a cornerstone in mpox prevention. acam2000, produced by emergent biosolutions, is a live, replication-competent smallpox vaccine authorized under the fda’s emergency use authorization for mpox. while highly effective in preventing smallpox, its live-virus composition increases the risks of side effects, including myocarditis and complications in immunocompromised individuals. despite these risks, acam2000 remains a valuable option in outbreak scenarios. lc16m8, developed by km biologics, is a live attenuated smallpox vaccine with who emergency use listing. administered via a bifurcated needle, it is effective as a single-dose vaccine for individuals aged one year and older. widely used in low-resource settings, it provides strong protection against mpox and smallpox with fewer side effects than acam2000. its affordability and ease of administration make it particularly valuable in endemic regions like africa. mrna vaccines, exemplified by moderna’s mrna-1769, represent a promising new platform for mpox prevention. currently in phase i/ii trials, this vaccine is designed to protect against both smallpox and mpox. early results indicate safety and robust immune responses. if successful, mrna-1769 could provide a flexible, efficient approach to combating mpox, leveraging the same mrna technology used effectively in covid-19 vaccines. these vaccines, with unique characteristics and clinical results, are integral to global mpox control efforts. their availability, coupled with public health interventions such as vaccination campaigns, contact tracing, and health education, is essential to mitigating outbreaks. the advancement of vaccine technologies, particularly mrna platforms, holds significant promise for enhancing our preparedness against mpox and other emerging infectious diseases. by leveraging these tools and strategies, the global health community can better respond to current and future outbreaks, ultimately reducing mpox’s burden worldwide. the attenuated strains used in the next-generation smallpox vaccines, including acam2000, lc16m8, and modified vaccinia ankara, not only have a better safety profile than the first- and second-generation smallpox vaccines, but also successfully stimulate the production of antibodies in atopic and immunocompromised patients. the live smallpox vaccination acam2000 has the benefit of being delivered in a single dosage. this medication is not recommended since it can proliferate in the cells of immunocompromised people. furthermore, pregnant women and anyone with eczema or atopic dermatitis should not be vaccinated. a small number of vaccinated people may experience cardiac problems. increased lesioning at the location of immunization is normal and should be expected. the lc16m8 vaccine is an attenuated smallpox virus vaccine. imvamune, a modified live attenuated vaccine, has fewer adverse effects and a safer profile than acam2000. known as imvamune in the us and imvanex in europe, it has a limited replication ability, making it suitable for all adults, including those with weakened immune systems. even after two doses of the live acam2000 vaccine, no skin lesions appear at the vaccination site. given the global impact of the mpox virus, particularly in the context of the covid-19 era, it is imperative that national and international research efforts be intensified. these efforts should focus on identifying virulence markers of the disease, understanding the factors that influence mpv evolution, which include both host and viral factors, investigating human behaviors that contribute to zoonotic spillover events, finding surrogates for asymptomatic infections, and examining the determinants of immunity for both the virus and the host. the goal of this research is to prevent mpv from filling the ecological gap left by the eradication of the variola major virus and potentially evolving into a more dangerous pathogen. to achieve this, the preventive epidemiological surveillance of mpv in endemic and high-risk areas, particularly in nigeria, is essential. this surveillance should be conducted routinely and not only in response to outbreaks. support the inclusion of routine and regular epidemiological surveillance of mpv in humans and animals in existing surveillance systems, such as the surveillance outbreak response management and analysis system. this would allow the early detection and effective management of mpox epidemics. the sewer coronavirus alert network was established in 2020 to test wastewater samples for the presence of the covid-19 virus. since june 2022, it has expanded to include mpxv detection in water plants. combining this network with a phylogenomic analysis could provide insights into mpxv’s spread and evolution. although criticized for being reactive, scan has proven effective in anticipating the virus spread, enabling frontline workers to control outbreaks and prevent a potential new mpox pandemic. 16. recent advances in mpox clinical trials the jynneos vaccine, approved for smallpox and mpox prevention, has been central to clinical efforts. recent trials have explored alternative dosing strategies, such as intradermal administration, to expand the vaccine supply. this method uses one-fifth of the standard subcutaneous dose, enabling healthcare providers to vaccinate more people without compromising immunogenicity. initial findings indicate comparable immune responses and safety profiles, making this approach vital in public health emergencies. other vaccine candidates, like acam2000 and lc16m8, have also undergone evaluations. acam2000, a replication-competent smallpox vaccine, has been authorized under emergency use for mpox. despite its efficacy, its side effects, such as myocarditis risks, limit widespread use. lc16m8, a live attenuated vaccine, has emerged as a safer alternative, especially for immunocompromised individuals. studies confirm its effectiveness as a single-dose vaccine, particularly in endemic regions. additionally, efforts to innovate mpox vaccines using mrna technology are underway. moderna is conducting early-phase trials for its mrna-1769 vaccine, aiming to offer a flexible platform similar to covid-19 vaccines. these trials seek to establish safety and robust immune responses, with large-scale studies planned in the future. complementing these efforts, the national institutes of health and the centers for disease control and prevention are conducting serological studies to track mpox transmission and evaluate vaccine effectiveness. these initiatives help refine outbreak responses and improve future preparedness. in terms of therapeutics, the antiviral drug tecovirimat has been a focus of several studies. this drug, initially approved for smallpox, has shown promise in treating mpox. randomized controlled trials in the u.s. and the democratic republic of congo are assessing its safety and efficacy for mpox treatment. the trials include diverse populations, including immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women, to gather comprehensive safety data. however, recent studies revealed that studies on tecovirimat in the democratic republic of the congo and by the nih found the antiviral safe but ineffective in improving mpox symptom resolution or pain reduction, including for clade i cases. these findings highlight the need for further research to optimize mpox treatments. 17. conclusions and future directions for mpox research and control measures indeed, the mpox virus has long been a neglected zoonotic disease with the potential to spread and/or be used as a bioweapon. there are now no traditional guidelines for clinical care, medications, or vaccinations, although the condition was originally diagnosed in 1958 and first recorded in a human in 1970. the limited research on the human immune response to mpxv infection remains unanswered. understanding immune defenses and the potential for mucosal protection resulting from smallpox immunization or mpxv infection is essential. investigating tissue-resident memory t cells and iga in mpxv-related respiratory complications is essential. factors like behavior, geography, diet, medical history, immunological factors, and genetics may also impact mpxv susceptibility and immunity. the virus can spread globally and has the potential to expand beyond africa. effective management strategies, such as ring-vaccination and pre-exposure vaccination, are needed to combat the outbreak. increased surveillance efforts, vaccination availability, and antiviral medications can help mitigate the threat of mpxv. moreover, it is a clear call to action for public health authorities to assume responsibility for informing specialists in the field of their results and being open and truthful with the general public. recent outbreaks around the globe have highlighted the significance of rigorous and ongoing surveillance, as well as the creation of novel preventative and therapeutic strategies. to stop rising transmission rates or virulence, appropriate and effective medicines as well as active monitoring activities are urgently needed. at least in endemic regions and possibly globally, the mpox virus is the predominant orthopoxvirus in humans. it takes a lot of effort to prevent mpox, which is no longer a rare condition. the human mpox virus should be monitored and controlled using the insights learnt from the covid-19 pandemic.
a comprehensive review on monkeypox viral disease with potential diagnostics and therapeutic options abstract the purpose of this review is to give an up-to-date, thorough, and timely overview of monkeypox, a severe infectious viral disease. furthermore, this review provides an up-to-date treatment option for mpox. the monkeypox virus has remained the most virulent poxvirus for humans since the elimination of smallpox approximately 41 years ago, with distribution mainly in central and west africa. mpox in humans is a zoonotically transferred disease that results in symptoms like those of smallpox. it had spread throughout west and central africa when it was first diagnosed in the republic of congo in 1970. mpox has become a major threat to global health security, necessitating a quick response by virologists, veterinarians, public health professionals, doctors, and researchers to create high-efficiency diagnostic tests, vaccinations, antivirals, and other infection control techniques. the emergence of epidemics outside of africa emphasizes the disease’s global significance. a better understanding of mpox’s dynamic epidemiology may be attained by increased surveillance and identification of cases. 1. introduction monkeypox is an uncommon disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus, with a mortality rate of 0–10% depending on the clade, which was first identified in wild animals such as rats and primates before spreading to humans. it was first detected in laboratory monkeys in 1958, and examining blood from african animals revealed mpox infection in various african rodents. the mpxv can infect a wide range of animals, such as a variety of squirrel species. there are still a lot of unclear questions about the mpxv’s natural history. additional research is required to identify the precise reservoir and clarify how the virus spreads among wild animals. the first case of mpox in humans was reported in 1970 in the democratic republic of congo, where an outbreak of smallpox was already occurring. before that, this virus outbreak was seen in monkeys in 1958, where pox-like disease was observed in the monkeys. the mpxv is a double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid zoonotic virus belonging to the poxviridea family’s orthopoxvirus genus. the mpxv has been divided into two distinct clades, the west african clade and the central african or congo basin clade. the cb clade was formerly believed to be more infectious and to produce more serious illness. the geographic boundary between the two groups is cameroon, which is the only country where both viral clades have been identified. the current outbreaks going on outside of africa are due to wa clade, which is significantly less virulent than cb clade. the rest of the world is also affected by mpox, making it a severe public health concern because it is not limited to countries in west and central africa. in 2003, the united states experienced its first mpox outbreak, which was traced back to prairie dogs kept as pets that had been infected. rats and dormice were brought to the us from ghana, where they shared a cage with the pets. over 70 people in the us contracted mpox due to this outbreak. there have also been reports of mpox in nigerians traveling to israel in september 2018, the united kingdom in september 2018, december 2019, may 2021, and may 2022, singapore in may 2019, and the us in july and november 2021. mpox outbreaks have been reported in various non-endemic countries since may of 2022. currently, researchers are working to better understand the spread of infection, its origins, and the methods by which it spreads. the release of movement control orders and the relaxation on travel restrictions after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic could be one of the risk factors for a mpox outbreak. the other possibility could be the evolution in the virus’s genome, which might play a role in the emergence of mpox. in a prior investigation, modifications to the genome of the mpxv collected in may, 2022 were described. additionally, the phylogenetic analysis of the recently emerged mpox revealed that these viruses belong to the west african clade and formed a distinct cluster. the authors suggested further genomic characterization to compare the hypervariable regions of these emerged viruses to obtain more insights into their evolution, which may affect their emergence. most cases in the recent outbreak have been found among men who are gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men. the health authorities are asking msm to be aware of the symptoms, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner. the symptoms of mpox often last between two and four weeks. life-threatening cases are more likely to affect children whose immune systems are less developed and whose medical conditions are more precarious. in other cases, even worse consequences can be caused by underlying immunological weaknesses. people younger than 40 or up to 50 years old are more vulnerable to mpox today because of the global halt of smallpox vaccination campaigns following the disease’s elimination in most countries. secondary infections such as bronchopneumonia, sepsis, encephalitis, and corneal infection can all result from mpox, which can cause blindness if not treated earlier. after surveillance in non-endemic countries strengthens, the world health organization expects to see an increase in the total number of mpox cases. actions that can be taken right now include educating individuals at risk of contracting mpox and stopping the disease from spreading further. most likely to contract mpox are those who have had direct physical contact with an infected person when they are still sick. as part of the who’s efforts to ensure the safety of healthcare workers and others, including cleaners, the who provides guidelines on how to protect frontline healthcare personnel. the present review aimed to increase public awareness, offer technical support for the preventive measures, and influence readiness and reaction activities. the relevant literature was searched in the pubmed, google scholar, science direct, web of science and scopus databases by using the keywords “monkeypox”, “monkeypox virus”, “mpox” and “orthopoxviruses”. 2. transmission it is still unclear how mpox spread to those early cases of the continents’ residents. the centers for disease control and prevention warns doctors to be on the lookout for individuals with rash infections that could be mpox, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. there are many hypotheses that state that it is transmitted from animals to humans, but human-to-human transmission is also possible. it can be spread by touching, aerosols, infected animal bite, or scratch. in a recent research study, a rotating chamber measuring 10.7 l that was designed to fit within a class-iii biological safety cabinet was utilised to test the mpxv’s susceptibility to aerosolization. the airborne viruses were found using culture and pcr after up to 90 h. for pcr analysis and culture analysis, the viral concentrations decreased by one log and two logs, respectively, in the first 18 h. between 18 and 90 h, the viral concentrations stayed the same, which shows that the mpxv may stay infectious in aerosols for longer than 90 h. an infected person’s respiratory droplets or skin sores or recently contaminated things might transmit the disease to another person through close contact. for respiratory droplet particles to transmit, face-to-face contact is often necessary, which raises the risk for healthcare professionals, household members, and other close contacts of active patients. the number of person-to-person infections in the longest chain of documented transmission, however, has increased from 6 to 9 in recent years. smallpox vaccinations have been discontinued, which may have contributed to a decrease in immunity in all areas. additionally, transmission can occur via placenta, as well as through intimate contact between mother and child after birth. mpox has a typical incubation period of 7 to 14 days. however, this can vary from 5 to 21 days. 3. pathophysiology of monkeypox there is a wide range of disease severity, from moderate to lethal. diarrhoea and vomiting, ocular scarring and conjunctivitis, encephalitis, and bronchopneumonia have all been documented as a complication of mpox. a common long-term complication of bacterial superinfection is permanent pitting scarring. there have been reports of miscarriage and more severe illnesses among pregnant women. for one to four days after the febrile prodrome with headache and tiredness, the patient will typically exhibit centrifugal development of deep well-circumscribed macularpapular, vesicular and pustular lesions. at each stage, lesions endure between one and three days. before or during the rash, lymphadenopathy may develop. the mpxv can majorly affect the host’s various organ systems, including the mucosal surfaces, skin, gastrointestinal tract, lymphatics, and lungs, which serve as protective barriers. airway inflammation and bronchopneumonia can cause skin exfoliation to be considerable, as well as the decreased willingness or ability to consume food or water. mpox can also lead to sepsis and other body organ dysfunction syndromes. 3.1. bronchopneumonia bronchopneumonia is a significant consequence of mpox, as it was previously known as smallpox. however, it is not well understood. a common outcome of the pulmonary assault of nhps at different infectious doses is the development of localised necrosis of lung tissues, fulminant bronchopneumonia, and diffuse pulmonary consolidation. several studies found that intratracheal deposition of virus-containing aerosols significantly worsened respiratory distress and increased animal death. although klebsiella pneumoniae just recently emerged in one of the animals that succumbed to its illness, the animals did not often develop future bacterial infections. the manifestations of mpox in people are similar to those of smallpox, although milder. a fever, headache, muscle aches, and tiredness are among the symptoms of mpox. mpox causes lymph nodes to swell, whereas smallpox does not, and this is the fundamental distinction between the two. the lesion of mpox progress as macule formation, papule formation, vesicle formation, pustule formation, and scab formation. patients experiencing increased body temperature, headache, cough, rash, myalgia, and lymph node enlargement three weeks after contact with prairie dogs or gambia giant rats should have their symptoms evaluated by a doctor to rule out the possibility of mpox. the state or local health offices should be notified at once if specific illnesses are detected in people or animals. 3.2. clinical manifestation comparison the symptoms of mpox are quite similar to those that were observed in the past in individuals who were suffering from smallpox, despite the fact that mpox is clinically less severe. it is brought about by the mpxv, which is classified as an orthopoxvirus and is a member of the poxviridae family of viruses. the poxviridae family and orthopoxvirus genus viruses consist of various viruses known to infect humans, including the mpxv, vaccinia virus, cowpox virus, and variola virus. in west and central africa, mpox occurs mainly in older children, adolescents, and young adults. in two large epidemiology studies of mpox outbreaks, the investigators observed a sizable number of coinfections of chickenpox and mpox. for variola, the case fatality rate majorly varied depending on the manifestation of the disease; nonetheless, aggregate case-fatality rates ranging from 10 to 30% have been observed over a number of outbreaks. the severity of the condition was found to have a correlation with the amount of rash that was present and was also found to be adverse in youngsters and in women during pregnancy. furthermore, mpox can also closely resemble a genital herpes simplex infection. indeed, a patient can have both infections at the same time. the clinical pictures of smallpox and varicella share a number of similarities with mpox, which are given as a comparison in table 1. 3.3. secondary co-infections due to the significant skin irritation, there is a high risk of subsequent bacterial skin infections, which have been shown to be prevalent in 19% of unvaccinated individuals with smallpox. before the formation of crusts, the skin of infected individuals usually remains bloated, rigid, and excruciatingly painful. the emergence of a second febrile phase, which takes place when skin lesions become pustular, has been linked to a worsening of the patient’s health status. a retrospective analysis of hospital records for a total of 40 human cases of mpox in nigeria found that most patients suffered from fever and vesiculopustular skin eruptions that resolved on their own and did not need any treatment. the patients who were also co-infected with hiv type 1 had more severe lesions, a longer sickness, and more vaginal ulcers and subsequent bacterial skin infections. according to the findings, hiv-negative individuals did not have all of these characteristics. the patients who survived after an illness were most likely to have permanent pitted scarring. the mortality rate of unvaccinated individuals is as high as 11%, and children are especially susceptible to severe sickness. in a previous study, unvaccinated patients were shown to have 74% more severe problems and sequelae than immunized individuals. a secondary lung infection has been found in patients who have developed respiratory discomfort or bronchopneumonia, generally at the end stage of their illness. by the second week of the disease, vomiting or diarrhoea can lead to severe dehydration. one patient had encephalitis, and another had septicaemia. eye infections can lead to corneal scarring and irreversible vision loss if left untreated. 4. outbreak history of monkeypox virus disease since 1970, there has been a steady increase in the number of reports of isolated outbreaks. there has been a total of 35 separate outbreaks recorded outside of the democratic republic of the congo, 20 of which have occurred since 2010. in 1996 and 1997, the outbreak of mpox occurred in the drc and raised questions about whether smallpox samples should be kept for comparison with other viruses such as mpox. a total of 71 cases of mpox, including six deaths, were reported in 13 villages of zaire between february and august 1997. in august 1997, when the outbreak was at its peak, the number of cases of secondary infections also increased. as the outbreak progressed, local health officials reported 170 new cases between march and may 1997 to the who. however, another study noted that some of these might be chickenpox cases. most cases of mpox have been found in communities living in rural areas, in small villages, or in humid evergreen tropical forests, near or within the human–animal interface places. furthermore, as a result of indirect or low-level exposure to sunlight, people who live in or near forest regions may develop subclinical illnesses. after smallpox was eradicated, the first known human case may have occurred due to the subsequent exposure to infection. the disease was extremely rare and only found in the rain forests of western and central africa, where it was first discovered in the 1970s. before the outbreak in the midwest states in 2003, no cases of mpox were reported in the us. later, 71 suspected mpox cases were reported between 16th may and 20th june 2003, of which 47 were confirmed cases. the score for the burden of skin rashes, mortality and morbidity, hospitalization rates, and the severity of illness were utilized to describe these diseases in humans. mpox viruses are divided into two main phylogenetic groups. the severity of the disease varies between the clades reported in the us outbreak in 2003 and the west african clade. between 1970 and 2005, there were fewer than ten reported cases of the west african clade in liberia, sierra leone, nigeria, and côte d’ivoire, while the us outbreak reported 47 cases. humans and non-human primates were affected less when infected with west african clade mpox. the outbreak in the us resulted in a large number of hospitalized patients, but no fatalities were reported. a human mpox case was reported to the who on 16 november 2021, by the ihr national focal point of the united states of america. the patient had recently returned from a trip to nigeria. when the skin rashes appeared, the patient was in lagos, nigeria. the patient left lagos, nigeria, on november 6th for istanbul, turkey, and arrived in washington, d.c., the us, on 7 november. while in isolation in maryland, it was confirmed that the patient had not had any previous vaccinations against smallpox. orthopoxvirus-generic and non-variola orthopoxvirus real-time -pcr assays on skin lesions were positive on 13 november at the maryland laboratory of the laboratory response network. the pcr testing performed on the identical two lesion specimens on november 16th confirmed the diagnosis of mpox. more specifically, it was the strain of mpox from the west african lineage that has been re-emerging in nigeria since 2017. because the patient had remained in lagos the entire time he stayed in nigeria, the infection source was unknown in this case. this case was the second time human mpox was found in a visitor to the us. non-endemic countries such as israel, singapore, and the uk and northern ireland have also reported six cases of human mpox among travellers from nigeria since 2018. there is a big chance that tourists from endemic areas were infected due to their frequent travel around the world. endemic outbreaks were recorded in the twelve months prior to may 2022, with the highest number of infected patients in congo. between 13 may and 21 may 2022, 92 cases of mpox in non-endemic countries were reported to the who. these 92 cases of mpox were confirmed through pcr testing. on 17 june 2022, a total of 2103 cases were reported to the who with a mortality rate of 0.09%. the confirmed mpox cases increased to 3413 on 27 june 2022. as of 17 august 2022, 39,434 cases had been reported, with a mortality rate of 0.03%. on 13 may 2022, the who started collecting information about the outbreak from all around the world, which was reported at the state level and by health institutions. suspected cases individuals of any age who present with a sudden onset of severe rashes with fever, backpain, myalgia, headache, asthenia, and lymphadenopathy in a non-endemic country could be considered as suspected cases. the following common causes of an acute rash are not supported by the clinical picture: allergy, bacterial skin infections, primary or secondary syphilis, disseminated gonococcal infection, and any other locally relevant frequent causes of the rash. a suspected case must have an epidemiological connection, close physical contact with skin or skin lesions, or contact with contaminated objects such as bedding, clothing, or utensils in the 21 days prior to the onset of mpox symptoms. after the start of worldwide surveillance, the who expects to see an increase in the number of cases of mpox. immediate measures include providing correct information to people who are most at risk of mpox infection, halting the spread of the disease, and safeguarding frontline workers. after recovering from the acute illness, retrospective instances discovered by active search may no longer exhibit the clinical signs of mpox, but they may still show scarring and other sequelae. in addition to current instances, retroactive cases may provide valuable epidemiological data. although retrospective instances cannot be scientifically verified, their blood may be obtained and tested for anti-orthopoxvirus antibodies to help with case categorization. samples obtained from individuals suspected of having mpox or from animals suspected of harbouring the mpxv should be handled carefully by qualified personnel working in appropriately furnished labs. when transporting samples to the testing facilities and packaging them, strict adherence to national and international rules on the transfer of infectious substances is required. to address national laboratory testing capacities, careful planning is necessary. in order to reduce risk to laboratory staff and, when required, safely conduct laboratory tests that are needed for clinical treatment, clinical labs should be informed before samples from patients with suspected or confirmed mpox are submitted. 5. diagnostic strategies usually, clinicians prefer a clinical diagnosis based on signs and symptoms and comparison with other diseases of the same category, such as smallpox and chickenpox. confirmatory diagnosis should be a laboratory diagnosis, and some of the diagnostic tools with their pros and cons are described below. 5.1. polymerase chain reaction identification based on the presence of genetic material or dna in a patient’s lesion material can be used to diagnose an active case. to conduct the test, a specimen must be stored in a dark, cool setting to preserve the viral dna. contamination problems necessitate the use of extremely sensitive assays designed to target the mpxv specifically. equipment and reagents needed for these tests are expensive. a professional facility with experienced technicians is required to conduct this test. 5.2. cell culture a chorioallantoic membrane can be used for live viral culture where this virus produces “pocks”. lesion specimens can be used for such cultures. the test takes several days to complete. the patient’s body might possess bacteria, which would make efforts at cultivation difficult. more characterization is needed for viral identification. it has to be performed in a big-capacity laboratory by skilled experts. 5.3. immunohistological techniques this technique may be used to identify the antigens in biopsy specimens based on antigen–antibody interaction. the application of this technique may be utilised to exclude or locate other suspected organisms. it must be carried out in a large laboratory by competent healthcare professionals. 5.4. elisa elisa is used to detect the antibodies against the mpxv in human blood, which is basically a point-of-care diagnostic tool that uses a patient’s lesion material to quickly diagnose an active case. the test may be performed at room temperature with minimal training. the mpxv is not detected by this assay. there must be endemic testing carried out. pcr is more sensitive. serological cross-reactivity amongst orthopoxviruses means that antigen and antibody detection methods cannot be used to confirm mpox. due to the lack of resources, serology and antigen detection procedures are not suggested for diagnostic use. 6. treatment and management studies of mpox sickness in animals have recently shed light on the disease’s biology, proposing specific aspects of supportive therapy that may be both realistic and successful at enhancing patient outcomes. in order to test the effectiveness of antivirals and vaccines, researchers were motivated by a desire to duplicate a severe smallpox-like sickness. up to this point, these studies have revealed therapeutically important information about mpox pulmonary infection and other elements of the severe illness’s clinical picture, such as signs of poor prognosis. multi-organ functions in the host can be adversely affected by mpox, which compromises the protective barriers of the skin and mucosa, causing a strong lymphatic inflammatory response and obstruction in the airways. exfoliation can be substantial in cases of a heavy rash burden, putting patients at risk of dehydration and protein loss. breathing can be severely restricted or perhaps impossible for a patient with bronchopneumonia, which is a severe inflammation of the airways. significant clinical signs of illness can also be caused by co-infections, as well as comorbidities. for patients in low-resource settings, a treatment plan must anticipate the likelihood of each of these outcomes occurring. in an ideal world, this evaluation would be based on scientifically sound criteria gleaned from extensive clinical research. in this way, resources can be used most effectively for the patient’s rehabilitation and the spread of virus is minimized. 6.1. therapeutic measures symptom relief, complications management, and long-term sequela prevention are all goals of optimal clinical care in the treatment of mpox. fluids and food should be provided to patients to provide proper nutrition. it is important to treat any secondary bacterial infections that may arise. on the basis of results from both animal and human studies, the european medicines agency granted a license to tecovirimat, an antiviral drug originally designed for smallpox. tecovirimat inhibits the intracellular release of the virus and is preferable because of its oral administration. some other vital drugs include the following:cidofovir can be used to inhibit viral replication by inactivation of dna polymerase which can be administered intravenously, which could be nephrotoxic.brincidofovir is an orthopoxvirus nucleotide analogue dna polymerase inhibitor and a lipid conjugate of the nucleotide analogue cidofovir and is indicated for the treatment of human smallpox disease. 6.2. vaccination according to a series of studies, more than 85% of mpox cases were prevented by vaccination against smallpox. the smallpox vaccine is the oldest vaccination and has undergone three generations of medical technology. in order to eradicate smallpox, first-generation vaccines were widely dispersed between 1950 and 1970. second-generation vaccinations, which were utilized in some regions of the smallpox eradication effort, were developed in chorioallantoic membranes or cell cultures for improved purity. prior to the eradication of smallpox, third-generation vaccinations, which were based on attenuated strains of vaccinia, were developed and used. two types of smallpox vaccinations can be used for mpox. the modified vaccinia virus ankara is one of the third-generation vaccines which are based on attenuated vaccinia viruses and is a live, nonreplicating vaccine. the mva is sold under the trade name jynneos in the usa. these are significantly less virulent and have fewer adverse effects. the mva, a severely attenuated strain of the vaccinia virus, is a potential vector platform for the creation of viral-vectored vaccines due to its qualities of efficient transgene expression and safety profile. traditional smallpox vaccines based on vv have a history of causing severe side effects in both susceptible and resistant individuals. mva is a replication-deficient strain of vv that has been shown to be safe in people and immunocompromised animals. the european commission has approved the advertising of vaccines for adults, even those with impaired immune systems. acam2000 is a smallpox vaccine that is capable of replication. this type of vaccine is recommended for only healthy, immunocompetent, and non-pregnant individuals with a high risk of exposure. acam2000 needs an infectious dosage to be administered through a bifurcated, sterile needle that is inserted about 15 times into the epidermis of the deltoid area of the arm. this vaccination has greater adverse effects than the mva vaccine. a papule will appear two to five days after immunisation and develop into a vesicle after a few more days. the vesicle achieves its maximum size in one to two weeks, after which a scab develops and sheds after two weeks. patients who receive the acam2000 vaccine often have moderate fever and lymphadenopathy within the first two weeks after vaccination. this vaccine is a single-dose vaccine and can be used for both human and animals. the t-cells are needed to stop progressive vaccinia in macaques that were injected with acam200. a study conducted by smith et al., showed that antibodies are the main form of protection against mpox provided by the current nonattenuated smallpox vaccination. 6.3. prevention mpox can be contracted by close physical or sexual contact with an infected person. personal safety measures include staying away from those who have symptoms of the illness, using safer methods of sexual encounters, washing hands with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand rub and observing proper respiratory habits. raising public awareness of risk factors and educating people about the precautions they may take to reduce their exposure to the virus is the main strategy for preventing mpox. the feasibility and appropriateness of vaccination to prevent and control mpox are now being studied in scientific investigations. a number of countries have or are implementing vaccination policies for people who may be at risk, including laboratory workers, fast response teams, and health workers. controlling an outbreak necessitates constant monitoring and quick detection of any new cases. close contact with an infected person is the most common way to contract the mpxv during an outbreak of human infection. there is an increased risk of infection for healthcare workers and their family members. healthcare workers caring for patients with mpxv infection or specimens from them should follow normal infection control procedures. the patient should be cared for by those who have been vaccinated against smallpox. public responsibility if a person notices a red rash with a fever or a feeling of being sick, they should contact a doctor and be tested for mpox. mpox cases should separate themselves until the scabs fall off and refrain from any kind of close physical contact. symptoms of mpox can be alleviated with supportive care at this time. the caretakers of a mpox patient should take all necessary precautions, including wearing a mask and disinfecting any surfaces and objects they have touched. 6.4. clinical management standard contact and droplet precautions should be used by medical professionals who are treating the samples of patients infected with mpox, whether the condition is suspected or proven. all healthcare facilities, including outpatient clinics and hospitals, are required to take these precautions. hand hygiene, proper handling of contaminated medical equipment, laundry, and garbage, and cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces are all examples of standard measures. for low-resource settings to offer the minimum standard of supportive care for mpox patients, it is anticipated that some expenditure, including investment in laboratory diagnostics, will be required. there is insufficient data to explain whether institutional investments in supportive medical services and therapies affect mortality and morbidity sufficient to justify the costs. there is a need for research that examines how therapy intensity affects patient outcomes. stockpiling treatment plans for eye conditions, obtaining vaccinations, or supplying personal protective equipment are all examples of ways to contribute to the resources required to maintain a minimum level of care. alternatively, even if an mpox patient only has mild to moderate symptoms, they are still a transmission risk until the skin lesions heal. healthcare workers’ response prompt isolation in a private room with efficient ventilation systems, a separate restroom, and supervision is suggested in patients with suspected or proven infection. if single rooms are not accessible, the use of cohorts might be employed to ensure a minimum of one meter between patients when an infection is suspected. a gown, gloves, medical mask, and eye protection—face shield or goggles—are all examples of acceptable personal protective equipment. for patients who are in close proximity to healthcare personnel or other patients, they should be instructed to wear a medical mask, if they are able to do so. as an additional precaution, lesions might be covered with a sheet, bandage, or gown in order to reduce the risk of infection. it is imperative that all personal protective equipment be removed from the patient’s isolation area before leaving the facility. 6.5. outbreak surveillance the term epidemic is used to define a tendency for a disease to affect a large number of individuals within a population, community, or region at a particular time. in places where there are no reported cases of such lethal diseases, a single case can lead to an epidemic later. similarly, a single mpox case can pose a significant public health threat, so clinicians should quickly notify national or local public health authorities of any suspected cases, regardless of whether they are simultaneously investigating other possible diagnosis. cases should be recorded as soon as possible, following the case definitions above or national case definitions. all suspected and confirmed cases are required to be reported to the who via the international health regulations national focal points in accordance with the ihr. in order to give the best clinical treatment, isolate affected people to stop the spread of the disease, and identify and manage contacts, it is crucial to monitor and look into mpox cases and clusters. the most commonly identified routes of transmission are used to tailor effective control and prevention methods. the monitoring of rash-like sickness should be stepped up, and skin samples should be collected for confirmation testing as soon as possible. additional public health investigations are being carried out in non-endemic countries where cases have been discovered, including extensive case detection and contact tracing, laboratory analysis, clinical treatment, and isolation under supportive care. to identify the clade of the mpxv responsible for this outbreak, scientists have used genomic sequencing when it was possible. a meeting of vaccine specialists is being held by the who. 7. conclusions and perspectives it is important to remember that orthopoxviruses continue to organically exploit new ecological and geographical niches, especially in this era of increased concern about bioterrorist occurrences. understanding the evolution of zoonotic orthopoxviruses, particularly the mpxv, may help us better understand how the variola virus, a pathogen with severe human pathogenicity and efficient transmission and a highly specialized host range, evolved. for decision making, it is important to understand how these unique mpxv clades affect human disease, as well as how these clades may influence future outbreak responses and diagnostic tests, as well as possible outbreak-related decisions on vaccines and therapies. mpox outbreaks in many non-endemic countries in may 2022, with no known links to endemic areas, are unusual. further studies are needed to identify the source of the infection and prevent it from spreading further. to protect the public’s health, it is critical to investigate all possible transmission channels as the cause of this outbreak is discovered.
recent developments in mpox prevention and treatment options abstract human mpox is an emerging epidemic in the world. the monkey pox virus belongs to the same family of zoonotic orthopoxviridae as that of the smallpox virus and exhibits similar clinical symptomology. information regarding its diagnostics, disease epidemiology, surveillance, preventive methods, and treatment strategies are being collated with time. the purpose of this review is to trace the recent events in the scientific platform that have defined new preventive and treatment strategies against mpox. a methodological approach has been used to gather data from the latest literature to comprehensively overview the emerging treatment options. the results portion will cover details regarding the prevention of mpox. it will also shed light on a brief description of contemporary vaccines and antiviral agents that have been evaluated for their treatment potential since the emergence of the mpox threat. these treatment options are setting the pace for controlling the widespread monkeypox infection. however, the limitations attached to these treatment strategies need to be tackled quickly to increase their efficacy so that they can be deployed on a large scale for the prevention of this epidemic becoming another pandemic in this decade. 1. introduction despite so many advancements in the field of biotechnology, the world still has to face the burden of epidemics that slowly become pandemics. the world has yet not overcome the covid-19 pandemic, and other viral epidemics are already here, such as mpox, dengue, and ebola among others. the mpox virus is a zoonotic double-stranded dna virus belonging to the family of orthopoxviridae. some other infectious viruses of the past such as poxvirus, variola, cowpox, and vaccinia virus also belong to the same family. most of these other viruses of this family have caused havoc in past decades due to their link with large-scale pandemics. therefore, scientists are worried about the evolution of an mpox endemic to the world. so far, these are limited to african countries; however, some recent outbreaks have been reported in other continents as far as america, asia, and europe. the situation is thus alarming for scientific and healthcare networks around the world. the main route of viral spread is through contact with infectious sores and scabs, sharing clothes and bedding, or through the bodily transfer of fluids. the symptomology of mpox infection is similar to smallpox infection with a characteristic rash, fever, and flu-like symptoms. according to who reports, approximately 68,000 disease incidences of mpox infection have been reported in endemic and outbreak regions. moreover, 68 deaths have been recorded since the reporting of the first case of monkeypox infection. at the time of writing this review, mpox has spread to 110 different countries of european, asian, american, middle eastern, australian, and south asian origin. the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment options for mpox are being developed from previous orthopox infection management. as it has a similar nature to smallpox and variola, the potential threat of the pandemic is the prime concern of the scientific community, and therefore vigorous effort is being made to deduce the effective therapeutic options and vaccination drives against monkeypox infection to avoid another biowarfare between humans and virus in the present decade. at present, the mpox is still in limited endemic form with mild and self-limiting disease symptoms. therefore, in most places, supportive care is being provided to patients, and preventive techniques are being promoted to avoid further virus spread in communities. however, the scientific community is still working continuously to compose antiviral therapies and useful vaccines ahead of time to tackle any future threats possibly arising from mpox. as of now, two vaccines have gained fda approval, namely jynneostm and acam200®, which belong to live replication-incompetent and replication-competent vaccinia viruses, respectively. moreover, some antiviral agents such as tecovirimat, brincidofovir, and cidofovir are also being suggested for tackling mpox in severe diseased cases and immunocompromised patients. the purpose of this article is to briefly evaluate the work carried out in the direction of prevention, treatment, and therapeutic compliance with mpox outbreaks and to discuss some of the latest technologies that are being given due consideration for future research orientation in the field of vaccinology and pharmaceuticals. moreover, light will also be shed upon the need to carry out more research and collaborative work for preventing mpox outbreaks in non-endemic countries. 2. methodology a methodological approach has been used to gather the latest data regarding the different dimensions of mpox prevention and treatment strategies, which allowed the inclusion of data from diverse, recent, and the most-cited sources of research studies. 2.1. data extraction and search strategy we researched electronic sources such as google scholar, pub med, nih, scopus, and web of science. moreover, the official websites of the who, cdc, unaid, and fda were also used to obtain the statistical results and latest updates regarding mpox treatment efforts. as the study mainly incorporates the data regarding therapeutics and vaccines against mpxv, the major research terms were “monkeypox virus”, “mpox”, “mpox epidemic”, “therapeutics against mpox”, “antiviral agents”, “vaccines against mpox”, “vaccination strategies”, “therapies against mpox”, “novel therapeutic approaches”, and some other linked search terms. 2.2. inclusion and exclusion criteria after a thorough analysis of the dates, abstracts, titles, and journals of research publications, they were made part of this review. the process of information gathering was not limited to a few studies but rather collected from research compilations in the form of original research articles, reviews, short commentaries, case reports, and letters to the editors. finally, the search strategy was limited to incorporating data from 2018 to 2022 to add only the most recent advances related to mpox management, especially during the latest endemic updates of 2022. 3. results extensive data are already present regarding mpox etiology, epidemiology, latest updates on its outbreaks, infection cycle, host viral interaction, and possible viral targets for treatment purposes in recent publications. therefore, in this section we will only discuss the prevention strategies and treatment options, including vaccination and antiviral agents, that have come forward during outbreak months. the focus of the article remains, and readers obtain maximum information to understand therapeutic interventions against monkeypox infection. 3.1. monkeypox: course of the epidemic and possible reasons for recent decline in cases mpxvwas first reported as an infection of zoonotic origin in the drc back in 1970. it mostly remains endemic to 11 african countries, mainly the drc, for these past 50 years. vulnerable cases, including children, pregnant women, and the elderly with a suppressed immune system, are more prone to develop severe conditions. owing to its likely similarity with smallpox infection, the smallpox vaccine can be utilized against monkeypox as directed by the who. a few vaccine candidates, including the smallpox vaccine, vaccine candidates, and antiviral agents reported in; tabular format in this study, are currently being employed and tested for the treatment of mpox in endemic regions. the endemic nature of mpox has slowly taken the form of an epidemic due to reported cases in different far-off countries, such as the reported outbreaks in nigeria in 2022. similarly, some cases have been reported in the uk, back in april 2022. according to the who, approximately 110 countries have already reported confirmed cases of mpox; these may include the uk, spain, portugal, canada, germany, belgium, italy, france, the netherlands, sweden, the uae, the czech republic, brazil, america, and most reported in the drc. however, it should be noted that the cases are pertinent to change on an everyday basis, and cases may be differently reported by the who and cdc by the time of this publication. until the date, 31 january 2023, ~ 21163 confirmed cases of mpox have been reported from 29 eu/eea countries. in the latest reports presented by the who, the regions of america and of africa have reported the highest number of mpox cases. however, there is also an observed decrease in overall mpox cases, by approximately 12.7%, compared to previous months. the possible reason for the declining number of cases might be that the high-risk core groups of individuals have been undergoing vaccination. this scenario has generated a vaccination-elicited immunity in high-risk core groups. mpox cases are thus declining naturally. moreover, the effective public health measure adoption in these endemic regions has also limited the spread of mpox infections. an additional factor that should be noted is that mpox has neither a lifelong survival nature nor has purely the characteristic nature of sexually transmitted diseases such as hiv. the disease mostly remains self-limiting and resolves within 2–4 weeks of symptoms, as the host slowly develops immunity against it. thus, it is taken as an acute infection. however, it remains still unknown whether the first time mpox elicits durable and protective immunity to protect the host from re-infection or else they required proper medication and vaccination to prevent future infections. moreover, the nature of sexual transmission is still needed to be confirmed, since the high-risk group seems to have adopted some behavioral modifications such as limiting sexual encounters, which is suggested as the major reason behind the reduced spread of mpox. owing to these factors, there has been a natural decrease in mpox cases worldwide, though the situation keeps on changing every day. 3.2. preventive measures against monkeypox whenever an infectious outbreak hits the world, the first step is to determine a prevention protocol against it. such is the case for the mpox resurging outbreak. for now, the approved vaccine is a smallpox vaccine that has been checked against mpox and has fda approval status against smallpox but is still limited to a specific group of personnel. thus, further clinical trials are needed for confirmed approval against mpox. other preventive measures proposed by healthcare authorities such as the who and cdc are outlined in the following section. • avoidance of direct zoonotic contact with animals that may carry mpox, such as monkeys and squirrels, etc. • avoid contact with objects that may be in touch with the infected animals outside of the infected places. • avoid contact with sick individuals with suspected and confirmed mpox since the infection easily spreads through body lesions. • proper sanitization and hand washing after contact with infected objects, places, and animals and use of personal protective equipment when encountering infected individuals. • thorough washing and proper cooking of animal meat products. • adopting careful measures during physical interaction. • isolation of infected individuals to avoid infection spreading to other persons. • wearing medical masks and gloves in cases of confirmed mpox. • proper disinfection and cleaning of infected places and hospital floors. • increase public awareness regarding risks of infection, preventive measures, and possible treatment options. • people with an increased risk of developing infection such as medical staff, laboratory workers, scientists, response teams, healthcare workers, and captive animals must be subjected to pre-exposure vaccination to avoid infection spread. • captive animals with the infection must be separated from other animals with proper quarantine care. 3.3. pre-exposure prophylaxis in addition to the above-mentioned points, healthcare authorities including the advisory committee and immunization practices have recommended the pre- and post-prophylaxis vaccination for a specific group of people. for pre-exposure prophylaxis, vaccination with the fda-approved vaccines is recommended for people working for healthcare authorities with occupations where direct exposure to orthopoxviruses is predicted. these may include laboratory technicians and workers, clinical personnel involved in viral disease management, response teams against outbreaks, and vaccination and diagnostic teams, as well as scientists researching on clinical samples of mpox. thus, proper vaccination protocols should be proposed for ensuring the safety for these personnel. 3.4. post-exposure prophylaxis pep is recommended upon unprotected contact with the skin mucous membrane of an infected person or with their bodily fluids, saliva, lesions, oral cavity, clothing, bedding, etc.. it may also be needed for people undergoing close space-sharing for long lengths with the infected person, which may expose them to viruses through aerosol secretions and viral presence in air particles. additionally, post-exposure vaccination is only recommended by the fda and cdc for high-degree exposures where there is a possible risk of contracting the virus but not a predictive confirmation as in the case of directly exposed persons. additionally, the lack of protective gloves and medical masks or contact-used material without pre- and post-exposure sanitization is a condition that sensitizes and necessitates vaccination. in cases of uncertain exposure or lower exposure rates, the recommended measures are to undergo diagnosis or monitoring before pep. transmission takes place with prolonged interaction with an infected animal or symptomatic individuals. thus, with informed guidance from the cdc, post-exposure vaccination should be conducted after approximately 4 days and within a period of 4–14 days to avert disease development. if conducted later than the two week period, the disease onset cannot be prevented; however, the disease can only be reduced. 3.5. therapeutics and vaccines enormous therapeutics have been proposed, with some having promising results against orthopoxvirus family members. these compounds have proven antiviral effects on smallpox treatment, but there are no confirmed results for mpox in human beings. however, as the first line of treatment, these antiviral agents, vaccines, and drugs are being utilized to avert the spread of mpox until a properly approved vaccine arrives in the healthcare market. 3.6. vaccination efforts against mpox as described earlier, it is too soon to expect a vaccine against mpox since the outbreaks have been quite recently reported in different countries; before the current outbreak, the mpox was limited to only a few endemic regions of africa. however, now that the virus is surging in different countries, scientists have increased the pace of research to deliver an effective vaccine specific against mpox along with efficacious antiviral drugs. at present, smallpox vaccines which exhibit up to 85% protection are being used for mpox, which is a good line to start. the epidemiological data indicate that most of the mpox-infected cases were those who did not receive smallpox vaccination in childhood or had never been infected with poxviruses or those who were born after the smallpox pandemic and eradication period. currently, only two smallpox vaccines have been approved for mpox: a brief report of both vaccines is discussed ahead. upon cdc recommendation, these approved vaccines are used in the form of pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis for some specific groups of people as discussed before. apart from the approved vaccines, some other vaccination trials are also going on. one such experiment was on the dryvax vaccine and the vaccinia virus vaccine, which were checked individually and in combination to determine the immune system response. the response came in terms of the initiation of cellular and humoral immune responses. moreover, some experiments on animal models compared the effect of vaccination on disease symptomology. vaccinated animals were healthier and exhibited fewer or no symptoms while the non-vaccinated animals exhibited various illness symptoms associated with mpxv infection. similarly, some animal models were checked for protein-based vaccination, and they experi
