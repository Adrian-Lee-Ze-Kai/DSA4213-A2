tation of a recent introduction from a single animal source, followed by human‐to‐human transmission chains. this conclusion concurs with two prior studies which reported genome sequences from a south kivu hospital that defined the new clade ib viruses. molecular clock analysis dated the common ancestor of the south kivu genomes to mid‐september . when sequencing viral genomes from mpox patients in the western kinshasa province, a co‐circulation of clade ia and clade ib strains was detected in the summer . together with the spread of clade ib from south to north kivu and to adjacent eastern african countries, the detection of clade ib in the proximity of the international city of kinshasa represents a strong danger signal for a potential international spread of clade ib mpxv. republic of congo and central african republic genome sequences from mpox patients of the republic of congo, situated to the west of drc, collected in early revealed exclusively clade ia viruses, separated into two subclusters. one cluster resembled viruses detected in the central african republic, situated to the north of drc. the other cluster corresponded to viruses currently circulating in drc and shared sequence identity in excess of .% with them. as most mpox cases in car occurred at the northern edge of rainforests, transmissions from wild animals living in the rainforest were considered likely by the authors. political instability increased the frequency of contact with rainforest animals in that region. nigeria in contrast, viral genomes recovered from nigeria in all belonged to the clade iib, more specifically to the sub‐lineage a. they were closely related to the viruses causing the outbreak in nigeria and to exported mpox cases detected in the us, uk, israel and singapore. however, they were distinct from clade iib viruses of lineage b1, which caused the worldwide mpox epidemic in /. phylogeny tree analysis implementing measures to control mpox outbreaks will require an in‐depth understanding of how the virus is transmitted. therefore, a survey analysing more than mpxv genome sequences, collected from countries between and presents an important basis to address this question. the resolution is somewhat limited by the fact that % of the sequences were derived from clade iib viruses of the b1 lineage of the /epidemic. clade i viruses have mostly been isolated from the congo basin area; the earliest sequence was from . when reconstructing a temporal phylogenetic tree, the most recent common ancestor of clade i was dated to . as viruses from different geographical regions often did not cluster within the phylogenetic tree, multiple introductions of clade i into local populations were deduced. the recently emerged clade ib viruses spread beyond the congo basin, but also clade ia was detected elsewhere, for example in sudan in . for clade i, % of the sequences were derived from human isolates, with rare sequences derived from chimpanzee, shrews and squirrels. in contrast, only % of clade iia sequences were from humans, while % were from chimpanzees, which are, however, a spillover host rather than a reservoir host for mpxv. also, the prairie dog isolate causing the infections in the us belongs to clade iia. the oldest clade iia isolate dates from . clade iia was not any longer isolated after . clade iib was first detected in nigeria in and continued to circulate in west africa by human‐to‐human transmission. it was then exported to other countries in europe, asia, north america and north africa, with sustained human transmission in the eastern mediterranean. from this clade, now called clade iib lineage a, a descendent clade iib lineage b.emerged in that caused the worldwide mpox outbreak. clade iib viruses exhibit a higher substitution rate than other orthopoxviruses and display a clear apobec‐mutation signal. clade iia shows similar mutational processes as clade ia viruses, lacked the apobec‐signal which suggests that they circulated outside of the human population. mpxv has a mutation rate that is ‐fold higher than that of varv, the agent of smallpox, and approaches that of some rna viruses. chinese researchers investigated the spectrum of mutations in mpxv during the outbreak in shenzhen. they observed missense, synonymous and mutations in non‐coding regions. viral proteins involved in host modulation, surface exposure, dna replication and viral assembly were affected by mutations. spanish researchers noted that variation in short tandem repeats within the low‐complexity regions of the mpxv genomes was greater than that of single‐nucleotide polymorphisms and could affect the expression of several viral proteins. transmission characteristics and nonpharmaceutical interventions phylogeographic approaches while the epidemiology of the current clade ib mpox epidemic cannot be directly compared to that of clade iib.b1 of the worldwide epidemic, the wealth of sequence information for the latter is a valuable source for epidemiological insights into possible transmission mechanisms and therefore provides hints for efficient containment measures. a phylogeographic approach with more than iib.b1 sequences allowed several conclusions in that respect. the most recent common ancestor for the worldwide epidemic was traced to west europe in march . a rapid early spread in western europe led to a high number of introductions into other global regions with more than introduction events. there was strong evidence for viral circulation before detection of the epidemic in each global region. asymptomatic infections asymptomatic mpxv infections further complicated the epidemiological situation. in studies from drc during the 1980s, a ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic infection of :was seen in unvaccinated contacts of clade i mpox patients. asymptomatic infections were also observed in the clade ii mpox epidemic. among men attending a belgian sexual health clinic in may four mpxv positive cases were detected; three had no mpox symptoms while being positive for mpxv in pcr tests. they yielded a replication‐competent mpxv of clade iib.b1 and seroconverted to mpxv. the authors concluded that testing and quarantining of individuals reporting symptoms may not suffice to contain an outbreak. this conclusion was confirmed by a study in gay or bisexual men conducted between august and october in spain, mostly migrants from latin america. seven were mpxv positive in pcr tests, six showed no mpox symptoms, but three shed infectious virus. also, serological surveys conducted during the mpox epidemic suggested a substantial number of asymptomatic mpxv infections. among subjects from new york, % of them were msm, % showed orthopoxvirus‐specific antibodies but reported no recent mpox symptoms and had not received smallpox or mpox vaccination. similarly, among patients from sexual disease clinics in san francisco who had no prior poxvirus vaccination nor received an mpox diagnosis, % showed orthopoxvirus‐specific igg during the mpox epidemic. r values and superspreading when analysing transmission chains resulting from mpxv introduction events, paredes et al. identified a bimodal pattern. only a small number of introductions resulted in a sustained expansion of local transmissions where some individuals tended to contribute disproportionately to infection events, while two thirds contributed no new infections. clusters of identical sequences ranged from to the latter pointing to superspreading events. the authors of this study computed r
t, the time‐varying effective reproductive number of the virus, to be between .and in the initial phase of the epidemic. already in september r
t had dropped to < . notably, r
t fell below before % of the high‐risk us population developed immunity to mpxv by vaccination. the researchers concluded that rapid pathogen detection and concomitant behavioural change were likely sufficient to curb the epidemic spread. kinetics of viral release control measures also depend on the kinetics and the amount of virus released by mpox patients and the persistence of the virus in the environment. during the mpox epidemic, chinese researchers analysed viral positivity by qrt‐pcr in body and environmental samples from mpox patients over a ‐week period after disease onset. viral load was highest in skin lesions, peaked in the first disease week, but remained high into the third week. the next highest viral loads were detected in rectal samples while saliva samples were low and close to a viral load considered unlikely to transmit the disease. environmental samples taken around the mpox patients showed a considerable viral contamination that persisted over the observation period, particularly on the floor, bedside, and in air conditioning outlets. an mpxv‐specific antibody response developed in the first weeks after symptom onset. in another chinese study, mpox patients from the epidemic were analysed over a ‐week period after hospitalisation. highest viral loads were again detected in skin lesions, followed by saliva samples. at discharge from hospital, % of the saliva samples and % of dry scabs were still virus‐positive; % of the dry scabs yielded an infectious virus upon culture. neutralising serum antibody titers increased over the hospitalisation period, and the titers were lower in mpox patients coinfected with hiv. a study from the uk which followed clade ii mpox patients for longer than months by both pcr and virus cultivation reported a median time of days after symptom onset for infectious virus isolation. however, in hiv co‐infected patients, infectious mpxv was isolated for up to days. the median ct value in pcr for which mpxv could still be isolated was . serial intervals dutch researchers analysed paired infector‐infectee mpox cases during the epidemic. a total of infectees reported a single potential infector. from these pairs, a serial interval of days was deduced. presymptomatic transmission may have occurred in of pairs. the scientists deduced that transmission can occur from days before to days after symptom onset of the infector. us researchers calculated a serial interval of .days and an incubation period of .days. the dutch scientists estimated a reproduction number r of .to .using the average doubling time of –days during june and suggested that a suppression of % of secondary infections should be sufficient to push r below . reinfection rhesus macaques were experimentally infected with mpox. irrespective of whether infected intravenously, intradermally, or intrarectally, the animals developed both humoral antibody and cellular t cell immunity after demonstrating skin lesions and a marked viremia. one month later, when skin lesions had resolved, the macaques were again challenged intravenously with clade iib mpxv. no renewed skin lesions were observed, and only a small transient viremia was seen. the marked upregulation of innate immune cell signatures seen after primary infection was not observed after re‐challenge. upon re‐challenge, the animals showed, however, a rapid activation of an anamnestic t and b cell response. based on the share‐net international clinical network documenting mpox cases from the worldwide mpox epidemic, physicians identified reinfection in eight gay patients about days after the first infection. symptom scores decreased from the first to the second infection, and the skin lesions resolved earlier in the second than in the first infection. this international consortium also identified breakthrough infections in gay subjects about days after they had received mva‐bn vaccination. breakthrough infections were characterised by few lesions. nonpharmaceutical interventions npi should thus have a realistic target as demonstrated by the rapid decline of the worldwide mpox epidemic after the summer before vaccination could have an impact on transmission. one important element was information on safer sex given to opinion leaders that was spread within well‐connected networks of msm circles. another classical npi is case isolation. current guidelines for mpox suggest quarantine of infected individuals for about weeks. a modelling study analysed three types of rules for ending the isolation of patients with mpox. under a symptom‐based rule, patients remain isolated until resolution of their skin lesions, which occurs on average after days. the researchers estimated that % of the patients might, under this strategy, still be infectious. under a fixed‐duration rule of weeks isolation, % of patients might still be infectious, but many individuals will be unnecessarily isolated. a solution to this dilemma is a testing‐based strategy with daily testing and release from isolation after two consecutive negative pcr tests. such an approach necessitates rapid, reliable, and cheap diagnostic tests. formats have been designed but not yet industrially developed that allowed mpxv dna detection in clinical samples with a min lysis protocol followed by a min single‐step recombinase polymerase amplification ‐crispr/cas13a reaction in a vest‐pocket analysis device, suitable for a point‐of‐care setting. behavioural change behavioural changes in the msm network might have contributed to the rapid decline of the worldwide clade iib mpox epidemic. to assess the potential role of these changes in sexual interaction, researchers conducted in may a survey among about msm subjects from european and american countries. adaptation to their sexual behaviour was reported by half of the surveyed subjects. people in this subgroup reduced their number of sexual partners, avoided group sex, sex‐on‐premises venues and chemsex. subjects reporting concerns about contracting mpox were twofold more likely to adapt their sexual behaviour. subjects with vaccination or those having experienced mpox were less likely to adapt their sexual behaviour. mathematical modelling with data from the epidemic in the italian msm community indicated that the significant behavioural changes in the community led to a rapid reduction of the reproduction number, r value, from .to .sufficient to stop the epidemic. the model predicted that the depletion of susceptible individuals was not the primary driver of the decline of the epidemic. contact tracing might have prevented a doubling of cases during the initial phase of the epidemic. in contrast, ring tracing and ring vaccination was unlikely to stop the epidemic. however, vaccinating subjects with more than sexual partners per year could reduce the r value to near and prevent a resurgence of mpox. pharmaceutical interventions: active immunisation classical smallpox vaccines since smallpox vaccines were propagated in cattle; by the leading smallpox vaccine source was calf lymph. the first generation of modern smallpox vaccines was live, unattenuated vacv, grown in the skin of cows and sheep. a freeze‐dried dryvax vaccine was developed in the 1950s, which allowed maintenance of vaccines without refrigeration. it was administered with a bifurcated needle to the skin leaving a vaccination scar which served as evidence for a vaccine ‘take’. however, a third of the vaccinees developed side effects including, in rare cases, encephalitis and even deaths. the second generation of vacv vaccines was propagated on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated eggs or in cell culture. when tested in children from indonesia, they had the same efficacy as the calf lymph vaccine but also the same side effects. acam2000 was developed from viral clones of the dryvax vaccine and was propagated in cell culture for mass production and is used as smallpox vaccine stockpiles in the us. the fda approved it in august also for the prevention of mpox. the modified vaccinia ankara strain is a third‐generation smallpox vaccine. a vacv strain from turkey underwent in munich more than passages on chorioallantoic egg membranes, which resulted in the loss of % of the viral genome. mva cannot replicate in human cells. it was used in west germany in the final phase of the smallpox eradication campaign. mva‐bn was also propagated in cell culture. it is administered by subcutaneous or intradermal injection. it is safer than acam2000 and of comparable immunogenicity and has also been approved for use against mpox. another third‐generation vaccine is lc16m8 developed in japan by growth in cell culture and on chorioallantoic membranes. it contains the complete vaccinia genome except for a truncated viral membrane protein b5. it was approved in japan after testing in children. early observations work conducted between and explored the efficacy of smallpox vaccination on the prevention of mpox in drc. overall, contacts of mpox patients were evaluated for the development of mpox. secondary mpox was seen in % of household contacts without vaccination scars compared to .% in contacts with vaccination scars from prior dryvax vaccination, indicating the protective efficacy of this smallpox vaccine also against mpox. dryvax vaccination protected also against asymptomatic mpxv infections. modern vaccination trials with classical vacv in macaques immunised with either dryvax or mva and subsequently challenged with mpxv, both vaccines protected the animals against mpox disease symptoms, but dryvax suppressed viremia better than mva. however, when immunisation and challenge were shortened to a ‐day interval, mva showed superior protection over dryvax, indicating a quicker onset of immune protection. mva‐bn vaccine was also given to children exposed to mpox cases in england as a post‐exposure prophylaxis. none developed serious adverse effects or mpox disease. all children developed antibodies against mpxv antigens b6 and b2, and a robust t cell response to mva‐bn virus. british researchers evaluated mva‐bn vaccine effectiveness against laboratory‐confirmed symptomatic mpox in an msm cohort using a case‐coverage approach whereby vaccination rates among cases were compared with population vaccination coverage. a single dose showed a vaccine efficacy of % against mpox during the epidemic in the uk. however, this efficacy was only achieved days after immunisation; at earlier dates, no vaccine protection was observed. similar data were described for spain in a national retrospective cohort study. during the mpox epidemic, mva‐bn pre‐exposure immunisation was offered to subjects eligible to receive pre‐exposure prophylaxis for hiv infection. each day, individuals receiving a first dose of the vaccine were matched to an unvaccinated subject, resulting in pairs. no protective effect of mva‐bn was seen during the first week after immunisation, while a ve of % and % was observed after and weeks of immunisation, respectively. a case–control study was conducted in the us between august and march with case patients and age‐ and region‐matched controls; all subjects were msm. ve against mpox was % for one dose and % for two vaccine doses; no difference was seen between subcutaneous and intradermal administration of the vaccine. in september about us citizens at risk of mpox had received two doses of the jynneos vaccine. subsequently, mpox cases in the msm group younger than years were analysed by vaccination status. mpox incidence among unvaccinated persons was .and .times as high as that among persons who had received and jynneos vaccine doses, respectively. only mpox cases occurring weeks after immunisation were counted. in another us study, mpox case patients were matched to control patients. overall, case and control patients had received a full course with two doses of jynneos vaccine, indicating a ve of % in this observational study. for subjects receiving only one vaccine dose, ve was only %. the vaccine was applied subcutaneously or intradermally. notably, intradermal injection needs only a fifth of the subcutaneous dose. another way of applying limited vaccine to a large high‐risk population is to use only one dose instead of the recommended two doses. this strategy was tested in israel with an observational retrospective study. about at‐risk subjects were identified in a health register; half of them were vaccinated with one dose of jynneos. overall, five of the vaccinated and of the unvaccinated subjects experienced mpox after vaccination. ve was with % high, but the low number of mpox cases limits the study conclusion. a meta‐analysis of vaccine studies conducted mostly with mva‐bn in gay and bisexual men during the worldwide epidemic indicated a ve of % for one and % for two vaccine doses. post‐exposure ve was only %, but more data are needed as well as data for non‐msm populations and clade i virus another meta‐analysis of vaccination trials with mva‐bn reporting ve against mpox and immunogenicity to vacv found a significant correlation between ve and vacv‐binding elisa antibody titers. a second dose increased the antibody titre tenfold over a one‐dose regime, but increased ve only moderately. delaying the time between the first and second dose increased the vacv‐specific antibody titre and prolonged the durability of protection. mrna vaccines efficient vacv‐based vaccines were thus available that also protected against mpox and stockpiles were maintained. however, these stocks were insufficient when meeting the needs of the worldwide mpox epidemic. therefore, the pioneers of the mrna vaccine producers against sars‐cov‐extended this platform to mpxv. they developed nucleoside‐modified mrna encoding the clade iib mpxv antigens a35 and b6, as well as m1 and h3. in mice, twice immunised with each mrna species individually or combined into a trivalent or quadrivalent mrna vaccine, all mrna vaccines induced a robust humoral and cellular immune response against the targeted antigen. the multivalent and the monovalent m1 mrna vaccines also induced robust neutralising antibody titers against mpxv and vacv. multivalent, but not a35 + b6 vaccines protected mice against challenge with clade iib and clade i mpxv. multivalent and monovalent mrna vaccines protected mice also against vacv challenge. multivalent mrna vaccines given in two μg doses assured survival in macaques challenged by the intratracheal route with clade i mpxv. the mrna vaccine prevented lesion development and attenuated, but did not prevent viremia and weight loss. clinical evaluation of bnt166 is underway with a phase i/ii clinical trial. chinese researchers had chosen three mv proteins and two ev proteins for a pentavalent mrna vaccine. two intramuscular injections with μg rna induced igg elisa antibody increases against all five proteins and a ‐fold and ‐fold nab increase to vacv and mpxv, respectively. significant antigen‐specific cd4+, but no cd8+ t cell responses were measured in vaccinated macaques. upon challenge of the monkeys with a circulating clade iib mpxv from china, the vaccinated animals showed decreased mpox skin lesions, suppressed viremia and no virus excretion, and reduced cytokine production when compared to control macaques. the researchers also explored the immune response to the pentavalent mrna vaccine in naïve and immunodeficient rhesus monkeys. immunodeficiency was induced by infection with simian immunodeficiency virus. a robust antibody and a somewhat reduced cd4+ t cell response against the mpxv antigens were observed in the siv‐infected compared to control rhesus monkeys. macaques were twice immunised with a mrna lipid‐nanoparticle vaccine containing four mpxv mrnas, with mva or with buffer as control. one month after the boost vaccination, the macaques were intravenously challenged with a lethal dose of clade i mpxv. both mrna and mva vaccinated macaques survived while % of the control animals died. the mrna vaccine also protected against morbidity while mva immunised macaques developed severe and grave disease which was, however, attenuated compared to control animals. morbidity was quantified by lesion counts, viral burden in blood and in the throat, weight development and disease duration. with all criteria, mrna achieved superior protection over mva vaccination. the mrna vaccine induced a higher clade i and ii mpxv nab titre than mva immunisation. the mrna vaccine also induced better fc‐functional activities than mva. cellular immune responses were not measured in this study. as the mrna vaccine also reduced the viral titre in throat swabs, one might even expect a vaccination effect on viral transmission and not only on disease prevention. a clinical trial is underway. another study in rhesus monkeys compared the efficacy of mva, acam2000 or ad35 vector–based vaccines, expressing l1/b5 or l1/b5/a27/a33 mpxv proteins, against an intravenous challenge with a high dose of clade iib mpxv. all vaccines provided protection, but to various degrees. acam2000 mediated complete protection, while mva and the adenovirus‐vectored vaccine only conferred incomplete protection. protection correlated with nab titers. passive immunisation a report from demonstrated that macaques which received an immunoglobulin preparation from recently vaccinated subjects were protected from lethal challenge with mpxv, but they still developed skin lesions, increasing in number with decreasing nab titers. no protection was achieved in this animal model with normal immunoglobulin preparations. another group developed monoclonal antibodies against the vacv b5 antigen, which displayed vacv neutralising activity and protected mice against a lethal challenge with vacv, but viral load was only moderately decreased compared to controls. us researchers developed mabs from immune human subjects. half of them displayed in vitro neutralising activity and many were cross‐reactive against several orthopoxviruses, including mpxv. however, most individual mabs reduced viral plaque numbers by only %. it needed a mixture of six mabs to achieve a good in vivo protective activity in mice challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of vacv. prophylactic application of this mab mixture achieved a ‐fold reduction of the virus load in lungs, and all treated mice survived. in immunodeficient mice, the mab mixture achieved a sterilising immunity and assured a % survival. a human subject vaccinated against smallpox yielded two mabs, which bound distinct epitopes on mpxv b6 protein. upon intraperitoneal injection, these two mabs protected vacv‐challenged mice against weight loss and modestly reduced lung titers by tenfold compared to controls. a combination of two mabs directed against protein d8 and a33 found on mv and ev, respectively, protected mice from mpxv‐induced mortality and morbidity when given up to days after viral challenge. antivirals tecovirimat binds the peripheral membrane protein f13 of ev, which is conserved across orthopoxviruses. f13 elicits production of wrapped virions, an intermediate step of intracellular virus maturation. the antivirals cidofovir and brincidofovir target the dna polymerase of orthopoxviruses. these three drugs inhibited diverse mpxv isolates from the epidemic in cell culture at concentrations that were achieved after oral dosing in humans. in vitro inhibition was observed for clade ia, ib, iia and iib mpxvs. a few tecovirimat‐resistant mpxv mutants have been described in immunocompromised mpox patients that were treated for extended periods. however, these mutants were not seen in clade ib isolates and only with low frequency in clade iib isolates. macaques infected intravenously with a lethal dose of mpxv and treated at days or with tecovirimat showed % survival when treated with mg drug/kg body weight. with further treatment delay to day after viral inoculation, the survival rate dropped to %. five daily tecovirimat doses were associated with higher survival than three daily doses. the trial was conducted under fda's animal efficacy rule for the treatment of smallpox. in a safety evaluation with human subjects treated twice daily for days with mg tecovirimat, adverse events were observed with similar frequency as in the placebo group. tecovirimat was approved by fda to treat smallpox and can be used for mpox under an expanded‐access investigational new drug protocol. in a us study, patients with advanced hiv who experienced severe mpox were treated with an extended tecovirimat course. despite treatment, they experienced prolonged hospitalisation and high mortality. notably, half of the patients showed a viral mutation that may indicate tecovirimat resistance. in the us, tecovirimat was prescribed under ea‐ind for over patients with painful anogenital lesions during the /mpox epidemic. for patients an outcome was documented, but since they were not part of a clinical trial, neither safety nor efficacy could be demonstrated. two recent controlled trials were conducted with tecovirimat. the stomp trial, which enrolled msm patients from four continents with clade ii mpxv infections during the worldwide mpox epidemic, was stopped for futility after % of the targeted patients were enrolled, and no treatment effect could be documented. the palm007 trial enrolled children and adults with clade i mpox disease from drc. tecovirimat treatment had no effect on time to healing of skin lesions, virus levels in blood, skin lesions and importantly, no effect on mortality, which was .% in both the treatment and placebo groups. not much evidence exists for the efficacy of other drugs against mpxv infection. brincidofovir showed a modest survival effect in prairie dogs intranasally challenged with a lethal dose of mpxv. when the drug was given before or together with the challenge virus, half of the animals survived; when given day after infection, only % of the animals survived compared with % in the placebo group. otherwise, two cases of severe disseminated mpox infection in renal transplant recipients were successfully treated with brincidofovir. antiviral research against mpxv clearly needs new compounds targeting distinct viral proteins. german researchers conducted a multi‐omics analysis of the transcriptome, proteome, and phosphor‐proteome signatures of mpxv‐infected primary human fibroblasts to identify new targets. they identified perturbations of immune‐related pathways and changes in the dynamic phosphorylation of both host and viral proteins. these infection‐elicited molecular fingerprints identified nearly drug targets. based on these insights, they selected drugs. as a proof‐of‐concept drug target validation screen, they tested these drugs in cell culture for an attenuated mpxv cytopathic effect, for growth inhibition of a vacv reporter and for reduction in mpxv mrna accumulation. they identified two candidate antiviral compounds. interestingly, tecovirimat, while reducing the amount of released virus, did not inhibit intracellular viral mrna accumulation or cytopathic effects. political considerations the who's contingency fund for emergencies released us$ .million for fighting mpox, with more to come with the pheic declaration. commentators in a leading medical journal judged these funding levels insufficient to support a robust emergency response. the mpox continental preparedness and response plan for africa, co‐led by who and africa cdc, formulated pillars of action. it pledged financial resources but for a timely implementation an increased african leadership is pivotal for success. likewise, when the who declared a second pheic for mpox, japan has pledged up to .million doses of its lc16m8 vaccine, and the european union agreed to distribute doses while the us offered just vaccine doses. however, even when taking japan's pledges at face value, this still falls short of the demand for million vaccine doses expressed by the africa cdc. when resources are limited, decisions by local public health and political authorities are needed. model calculations showed that vaccinating % of all children younger than years in endemic regions such as drc could lead to a % reduction in cases and a % reduction in deaths, but still require million vaccine doses. some lessons from the covid‐pandemic have apparently not been learned. for example, african countries still lack the resources to track the disease, the facilities to make their own vaccines, and a regulatory infrastructure in the form of an african medicines agency. pheics are by definition a global threat to health that needs a coordinated response from leaders everywhere. a response includes the training of health workers, the organisation of genomic and epidemiological surveillance, conducting clinical trials, the development of diagnostic tools, and monitoring of animal reservoirs. much fewer viral genome sequences have been determined for clade i mpxv from africa than for clade ii in the northern hemisphere, which hampers the delineation of viral variants and the design of containment measures, which are most efficient when implemented within days after an outbreak. after a pandemic such as covid‐people are all too eager to forget their painful experiences. psychologically, it might be understandable to suppress past pandemic experiences to maintain an optimistic view into the future. rationally, this is not a helpful attitude. not learning the lessons from a past painful experience and taking appropriate actions accordingly means risking living again the same painful experiences. denying scientific evidence is self‐harming. the covid‐pandemic has revealed not only a loss of rationality in substantial parts of our societies but also a flood of health misinformation and deliberate disinformation. as the lancet wrote, health misinformation was weaponised as propaganda, exploiting fear, undermining public trust, and hindering collective action in critical moments. it became a deliberate instrument to attack and discredit scientists and health professionals for political gains. while who encourages responsible communication and flags misleading content, social media such as meta has decided to drop fact checking. deliberate disinformation on both classical and social media is extensively and increasingly used by authoritarian regimes to subvert liberal democracies. to this attack comes now the downsizing of the very institutions we need for fighting the spread of epidemics by the current trump administration. the us withdrawal from who, the dismantling of usaid, the mass lay‐offs at cdc, the freezing of research money at nih, and the intention of the new us health secretary to instruct the nih to take ‘a break’ from infectious diseases, all these measures are serious blows for pandemic preparedness. while one might still understand the unwillingness of us taxpayers to support fragile and underfunded health systems run by african governments, which in addition foster epidemic spread by wars, such political decisions in affluent societies are shortsighted since epidemics do not know frontiers. even large oceans are no physical barriers to epidemic spread as dramatically seen for west nile virus epidemic, covid‐the /mpox epidemic and the avian influenza epidemic, which all had major impacts in the us. sadly, the current us government follows chaotic decisions even when the interests of us citizens are at stake, as in the avian flu/dairy cattle epidemic ongoing in the us. usda must now try to rehire scientists for an avian flu response who were just fired to cut governmental costs. viral epidemics are increasing in frequency. this is now the worst moment to upset public health institutions such as cdc, which were the envy of the world. cdc websites were taken down and a prime source of public health information such as cdc's mmwr failed to appear for political pressure, which has not happened in years. scientists and doctors must stem this erosion of public health and infectious diseases research in the us. the us government deliberately renounces being the leader of science in general and in infectious diseases research, in particular. european countries must try to fill this void created by the current us administration. the european countries have now realised that they must stand on their own feet and spend hundreds of billions of euros on defence. scientists in europe should lobby that defence does not only mean to withstand the military threat of dictatorial systems but that defence should also include protection of their populations from future pandemic threats. if a fraction of the planned defence budgets is taken to fight infectious diseases, a lot can be done and would also facilitate acceptance of the huge defence budgets by european peaceniks as well as stimulate the soft power of the eu. author contributions harald brüssow: conceptualization, investigation, writing – original draft. conflicts of interest the author declares no conflicts of

mpox: an emerging or re-emerging infection with a potential colossal burden on healthcare globally abstract the world health organization identified mpox, as a resurgent zoonotic epidemic caused by the mpox virus. it is an emerging and re-emerging pathogen with a range of hosts and geographical distribution worldwide. peer-reviewed scientific articles from to august related to global mpox research were extracted from web of sciencetm core collection and google scholar databases to gauge the extent of the infection. mpox is marked by a recent resurgence of infections across continents, with africa being the hardest-hit region. the mpox re-emergence has shown a new mechanism of transmission, with several causes such as a rise in the number of unvaccinated individuals, behaviour risk factors, waning immunity, genetic evolution, and environmental circumstances. preventive and control measures of mpox include vaccination and patient isolation, while treatment involves antivirals and antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections. laboratory diagnosis entailing polymerase chain reaction can be effective for routine purposes, but results of serological tests must be interpreted with caution, because of cross-reacting determinants among orthopoxviruses. the structure and classification of the mpox virus, clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, epidemiology, historical antecedent, therapeutics, vaccines, and laboratory diagnosis of the disease are explicated, showcasing mpox as an emerging or re-emerging infection with a potential colossal burden on healthcare, and its classification as an international public health emergency by the world health organization. what this study adds this review provides the global situation of mpox as an emerging or re-emerging infection, warranting its designation as an international public health emergency. introduction mpox, formerly known as monkeypox by the world health organization, is a zoonotic viral infection with a cycle of transmission involving the active participation of wild animals.the mpox virus is regarded as both an emerging and a re-emerging pathogen with a varied range of hosts.the re-emergence of the mpox virus version with enhanced virulence since its first identification and reporting in monkeys in is favoured by the alterations in the virus genome resulting from mutations.although mpox was identified years ago, it has been ignored in medical literature because of its rarity.however, it has recently been accorded much attention because of a trail of morbidity and mortality in different age groups worldwide, although its foci were mainly in africa.the mpox name is likely to have originated from the fact that mpox was initially identified in monkeys from singapore used for research purposes in and then transported to copenhagen in denmark.mpox is caused by a diverse and large group of orthopoxviruses7 and is characterised by symptoms that resonate with those of smallpox and chickenpox, even though mpox usually presents milder symptoms compared to smallpox and has a % fatality rate in people who are not vaccinated against smallpox.mpox is a viral disease that has been added to the who list of communicable diseases by viruses with the possibility for widespread and epidemic repercussions and fears after the coronavirus disease outbreak, hence its classification as an international public health emergency.by august a total of established cases of mpox had been recorded across countries, with deaths,resulting in apprehension regarding the geographic spread.even though the exact causes and reasons for the re-emergence of mpox are unknown, it is postulated that it could be a result of several factors, such as the increase in the number of people not vaccinated against smallpox, risk factors of behaviours of men having sex with other men, decreasing immunity, genetic evolution, and ecological conditions.the global spread of the disease is a health hazard.additionally, the recent disease modelling proposes that pandemics which are usually caused by emerging diseases are expected to surge in severity and frequency in the upcoming decades.hence, the review aims to report on mpox as an emerging or re-emerging infection with a potential colossal burden on healthcare. methods on august peer-reviewed scientific articles related to global mpox research were extracted from the web of sciencetm core collection and google scholar databases. the search included papers from to august and included phrases associated with mpox, monkeypox virus, mpox classification and structure, mpox epidemiology, mpox vaccines, and mpox laboratory diagnosis. in every study that was retrieved, only english-language literature was included. classification and structure of the mpox virus classification of mpox virus the mpox virus belongs to the poxviridae family, which comprises genera and species.the family is subdivided into two subfamilies, namely chordopoxvirinae, with species and genera, and entomopoxvarinae, with species and genera. twelve members of the genus orthopoxvirus have been recognised to affect both humans and animals.the variola virus is the commonly known member that causes smallpox, while others are known as the cowpox virus, camelpox virus, skunkpox virus, volepox virus, taterapox virus, akhmeta virus, abatino macacapox virus, raccoonpox virus, vaccinia virus, ectromelia virus, and mpox virus.structure of mpox virus and its genome the lipoprotein outer membrane of the mpox enveloped virus is oval or brick-shaped.the normal size of the mpox virus varies from nm to nm, with a double-stranded dna genome of almost .kb, and encodes proteins.the hairpin end of the linear genome is covalently closed and there are no free ’ or ’ ends.the genome ends consist of the kb inverted terminal repeats and nucleotide homopolymers. however, short tandem repeats have been observed in the genome.orthologous poxvirus genes are closely packed, and intergenic areas that are bp in length are uncommon.the ‘housekeeping’ proteins that are encoded by orthologous poxvirus genes in the conserved central area are responsible for transcription, replication, and virion processes. in the terminal domains, the proteins encoded by orthologous poxvirus genes are linked to the pathogenesis and host range.the mpox virus consists of two main clades: clade i, formally identified as the congo basin clade, and clade ii, formally recognised as the west africa clade.these clades are split into two subclades, namely clade ia and clade ib in clade i, and clade iia and clade iib in clade ii.lately, clade iii, consisting of hmpox-a, b.a..a.and a.has been reported in non-african countries, including mexico.clade iii varies primarily in regions of coding and is linked to the host’s recognition of antigenic determining factors and immune modulation.a total of single-nucleotide polymorphisms are reported from clade iii.the mutation of mpox is because of the action of the apolipoprotein b mrna editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide family of cytosine deaminases.pathogenesis and pathophysiology of mpox virus viral endocytosis, cell membrane fusion, and micropinocytosis accelerate viral transmission through oropharyngeal, subcutaneous, nasopharyngeal intramuscular, and intradermal pathways.the virus replicates at the location of inoculation, which leads to the virus spreading to different organs of the lymph nodes, blood, bone marrow, tonsils, and spleen, triggering inflammatory immune-mediated phagocytosis.this signifies the period of incubation, which usually lasts for days to days. through the guidance of the enveloped and mature virions, the genome and proteins of the mpox virus are discharged into host cells. intracellular mature virions encompassing the dna encoding the virus get generated when the virus mrna transcription and translation occurs.intracellular mature virions enfolded in the golgi apparatus fuse with the host inner cell membrane to form cell-related virions before being released into extracellular areas to produce extracellular enveloped virions.the mpox virus can be spread in different modes from animals to humans, or humans to humans. however, the general mode is through human contact with the bodily fluids of the infected animals.the distinction between mpox and smallpox is that mpox virus infection triggers lymphadenopathy in humans while smallpox does not. the early symptoms of mpox virus infection are muscle aches, headache, diarrhoea, fever, chills, vomiting, fatigue, and backache, which advance to fatigue, developing into secondary bacterial infections of the skin or blood and lung infections.the body of the infected person can be affected by lesions that are initiated in the oropharynx, and inflammation of the heart, brain or other organs can also occur.moreover, patients can also have neurological concerns in the form of encephalitis.the onset symptoms occur mostly in all age groups, although infants or the elderly might have a less frequent or different presentation of symptoms.epidemiology and historical outbreaks mpox virus was identified first in monkeys in during the occurrence of outbreaks in colonies of captive monkeys that were kept for purposes of research in a danish research institute, and has since evolved into a zoonotic infection affecting the human population.the first detection of mpox in a human host was discovered on september in a baby in the democratic republic of the congo.since the campaign for worldwide smallpox vaccination gradually ended between the 1970s and 1980s, and smallpox was eventually eradicated by the number of human mpox cases in africa has been on the increase.the who verified a case of mpox later in and since then the virus has spread globally with a ten-fold increase in the past decades.in active mpox surveillance programmes were started in the democratic republic of the congo. this increased the number of detected cases. a high number of approximately cases was observed in the democratic republic of the congo alone, whereas only cases were observed in other endemic countries, with children being most affected.in mpox surveillance programmes in the democratic republic of the congo were terminated because of the onset of another epidemic, termed aids, in africa. this prompted the who to redirect its resources on public health.there was a decline in the number of confirmed human mpox cases in the decade that followed. no case was reported to the who beyond . it was only in and that a cluster of cases were reported in the democratic republic of the congo among a cohort predominantly unvaccinated against smallpox.since then, outbreaks have been common in the democratic republic of the congo. annually, over cases have been reported since .in nigeria, there was a complete hiatus of cases for years until when mpox re-emerged. a sizable country-wide outbreak of over laboratory-confirmed or -suspected infections involving clade ii was then recorded.several factors, including population density, shifting patterns of land use, and declining herd immunity provided by smallpox vaccination were reported to be providing opportunities for more zoonotic transmission and outbreaks.in contrast, between and case reports of human mpox infection from other countries were infrequent.mpox re-emerged as a global outbreak in may with almost cases and deaths confirmed from countries around the world, especially in areas where the disease had not been common.in there was an occurrence of mpox in the united states3 with human cases that might be a result of close interaction with prairie dogs which were alleged to have been infected during a shipment imported from ghana.a recent outbreak was also reported in europe and africa, with suspected cases and total deaths recorded across different countries between and . the african region experienced a surge in cases in july . these data outline the outbreak trends across various geographical locations from to .the geographical location and demographics revealed mpox occurrences mainly in central, east, and west africa, as well as multi-country outbreaks for clade iib, lineage b.. demographics indicated morbidities of % and above, except for adults in burundi, across all clades and sub-clades, with a preponderance in men. sexual intercourse mode of transmission is reported to contribute more to the spread of the virus, especially by men who have sexual intercourse with other men.previously, the age of people infected with mpox ranged from months to years,where more than % of the mpox cases were seen in children under years of age.the attributable deaths also occurred in children.the median age of the affected people moved from younger children of years old in the 1970s to the median age of young adults of years between and .this could be because of the suspension of smallpox vaccinations which offered some form of herd immunity against mpox.however, recently in the age of people infected with mpox ranged from years to years, and men between years and years old continued to be excessively affected by the outbreak, accounting for .% of reported cases, while women account for .%. moreover, a rash is reported in % of cases with at least one reported symptom, and is thus the most common symptom.it was reported that the denotation of a symptom may differ throughout reporting systems in different countries as a result of a general lack of negative reporting and symptom classifications.management, potential therapeutics, and vaccines the treatment of mpox infections involves community-based and clinical measures to limit its spread.in community and clinical settings, patients should stay at home, and avoid contact with infected people, and healthcare professionals should follow guidelines to reduce the risk of infection.the guidelines include avoiding direct contact with skin lacerations, treating skin rashes with personal protective equipment, and wearing gloves.infected individuals should be isolated for approximately –weeks to decrease the spread of the virus and mitigate the impact of possible outbreaks.in addition, supportive care is essential for patients with limited antiviral therapies, including hydration, nutrition, symptomatic management, and antibiotic treatment.in immunocompromised patients, superinfection and eye infections can be managed with antibiotics.intensive care management and mechanical ventilation are often used for respiratory and neurological issues.potential antiviral agents new antiviral agents and vaccines such as cidofovir, brincidofovir, tecovirimat, immunoglobulin acam2000®, and jynneostm offer new therapeutic prospects for orthopoxviruses.smallpox, mpox, and cowpox share collective genetic similarities, which include shared surface proteins such as antibodies, and t-cell receptors.in addition, some smallpox vaccines create antibodies against a range of epitopes that bind to the shared epitopes of mpox proteins.the antiviral resistance of cidofovir is slow, affecting poxviruses through serial passage.it is effective in treating compound orthopoxvirus infections and is used in humans for poxvirus infections, molluscum contagiosum, and aids-associated cytomegalovirus retinitis.brincidofovir, a lipid-conjugated cidofovir analogue, was united states food and drug administration -approved in for smallpox therapy because of its comprehensive activity against double-stranded dna viruses and lower ec50 compared to cidofovir.its lipophilicity allows efficient entry into host cells and a prolonged intracellular half-life.oral brincidofovir has shown potential in treating poxvirus infections and pre-proactive therapy of adenovirus viraemia.tecovirimat, fda-approved in targets the v061 gene in cowpox and the membrane protein p37, which is responsible for extracellular enveloped virus formation.it is available in intravenous and oral forms and has no documented cross-resistance.it is effective in treating orthopoxviruses in animal models, preventing death, and reducing viral distribution to distant tissues.tecovirimat is used to treat orthopoxvirus infections in human patients because of its tolerance levels. four clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate its safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics.vaccinia immune globulin intravenous is an fda-approved immunoglobulin used to manage smallpox vaccination and adverse effects in skin disorders.it provides passive immunity but is not recommended for immunocompromised patients, diabetic renal complications, or sepsis history.clinicians may consider vaccinia immune globulin intravenous for complex mpox infections or t-cell immunodeficiency patients; however, live attenuated vaccines should be avoided months after vaccination.vaccines and immunisations first-generation smallpox vaccines were effective, but adverse effects led to subsequent vaccine development.currently, three licensed mpox vaccines are available: modified vaccinia ankara-bn, lc16-kmb, and orthopoxvac.the fda has authorised acam2000 and jynneos for smallpox prevention and cross-protective immunity.the vacv can be treated with vaccinations, either before or after exposure.post-exposure prophylaxis should be administered days or less after exposure, to prevent symptomatic infection.if mpox symptoms are absent, post-exposure prophylaxis can be administered up to days after exposure. the fda authorised jynneos intradermal injection as a route of administration for emergency use in august in addition to the previously approved subcutaneous injection.the jynneos vaccine, approved by the fda for alternative use in mpox virus-infected persons, works by eliciting humoral and cellular immune responses.preclinical research indicates that mpox vaccination is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, although there is no preclinical research available for paediatric patients, despite being safe in immunocompromised people such as hiv patients.the acam2000 is a licensed vaccine for smallpox and mumps, given in single doses and lyophilised for long-term storage.it aims to balance the risk of pathogenic mpox with potential side effects from replicative vaccinations. furthermore, acam2000 is not recommended for hiv-positive patients since they have immunosuppressed systems, as it is a live vaccine that can cause severe complications. attenuated vacv, also known as modified vaccinia ankara, requires two injection treatments. live vacv immunisation has been linked to skin infections, premature delivery, congenital abnormalities, stillbirth, and perinatal mortality.however, vacv immunisation has a safer profile and fewer side effects compared to acam2000.healthcare professionals and laboratory people who are at a high risk of exposure are also evaluated for pre-exposure prophylaxis.world health organization guidelines on therapeutic interventions and vaccines for mpox pre-exposure immunisation for high-risk persons and post-exposure vaccination within –days is suggested by the who’s normative recommendations for mpox, to avoid or minimise the seriousness of the disease.vaccination should be used in combination with public health interventions such as contact tracing, isolation, and surveillance.target product profiles, which outline required vaccination qualities, have also been produced by the who.clinical administration places significance on supportive care related to medicine, and antivirals according to who guidelines.to ensure the reasonable allocation of vaccinations, treatments, and diagnostics, the who has also set up access and distribution processes, and has modified its recommendations in response to new information.laboratory diagnosis of mpox a critical factor in the diagnosis of infections, including the mpox virus, rests on laboratory diagnosis.two of the definitive methods for the laboratory diagnosis of mpox infection are the direct and indirect methods. for the indirect method, specimens collected are screened for the virus, the nucleic acid, or the viral antigens. to identify the dna, nucleic acid amplification testing is employed for the direct method. on the other hand, immune responses to the viral antigens form the basis for the detection using the indirect method.specimen collection, transport, and storage the main sample for laboratory diagnosis of mpox infection is the skin lesions, such as swabs from lesion exudate or lesion crusts. ideally, lesions, crusts, and vesicular fluids should not be placed in a similar tube, to obtain good dna or prevent inhibitors.oropharyngeal swabs, rectal or genital swabs, semen, or urine may be collected based on clinical manifestations.blood samples are also used, especially when treated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. this process may increase the concentration of the virus; however, it may not align with samples collected from lesions, as viraemia typically occurs during the early stages of infection or the prodromal phase. sample collection should be done by trained healthcare personnel in an appropriate clinical or field setting, using personal protective equipment, and then transported to laboratories with the appropriate level of biosafety for analysis.after collection of samples for laboratory diagnosis of mpox, samples should be placed in the fridge at °c – °c or kept chilled at –°c within an hour after collection, before transportation to the base laboratory. emphasis is usually placed on the storage and handling of specimens while being transported. if it is anticipated that it may exceed days before processing of specimens following transportation, such samples must be stored at –°c or a lower temperature, or at –°c if storage will exceed days after collection, to obviate false negative results caused by, for example, inability to extract dna.virus isolation the first isolate of the mpox virus was obtained in from cynomolgus monkeys using monkey kidney and human amnion cells.in humans, the virus was first isolated from a patient with a skin infection resembling smallpox. this was achieved by infecting pig embryo kidney cells, homo sapiens epithelial carcinoma cells, and african green monkey kidney cells, where cytopathic effects were observed.although research laboratories have employed culture-based techniques for the identification of the mpox virus, the routine identification of the virus is not recommended by the who as it is not only laborious, but has low sensitivity and takes some days, and must be performed using a biosafety level-safety chamber.electron microscopy the use of electron microscopy is a known method for identifying structures, including the fine details of the virus after isolation. this method reveals that the mpox virus has a brick-shaped or ovoid format, displaying intricate internal structures such as a double-stranded dna genome and enzymes. although electron microscopy is useful in revealing progeny virions in different phases of assembly, immature and mature ones, in infected cells, it is not recommended for routine laboratory diagnosis of the mpox virus.serological methods the use of serology to ascertain immune responses, immunoglobulin m and immunoglobulin g antibodies to mpox infection by use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, plaque reduction neutralisation test, complement fixation test, haemagglutination inhibition, and immunofluorescence are all of diagnostic value. however, results obtained should be interpreted with caution because of cross reactions or shared antigenic determinants among the orthopoxviruses or, in recent cases of vaccination, against smallpox.clinical laboratory findings and biomarkers to complement laboratory methods, variations of biochemical and haematological indices, such as thrombocytopenia, rated as the most common, hypoalbuminaemia, leucocytosis, and increased transaminase level are critical.other findings indicate that higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase may be related to poor prognosis. in addition, cytokine modulation has been reported to correlate with the severity of mpox in humans.the cytokines comprise interleukins 1b, 2r, -and among others.the polymerase chain reaction test on lesions was, however, reported to give the highest clinical sensitivity, % – %,whereas the sensitivity of saliva, nasopharyngeal swab, and oral swabs was between % and %, seminal fluid was % – %,and rectal swabs were % – %.genome sequencing for epidemiological purposes or monitoring of transmission patterns as an adjunct to conventional laboratory analysis of mpox infection, whole genome dna sequencing is critical for observing differences in the viral genome over time. genome sequencing is not recommended for routine diagnosis due to its expensive outlay, high cost of reagents, and the advanced training required for the process. few samples of patients may require genome sequencing from samples as genome monitoring of circulating types may assist policymakers and healthcare personnel in terms of decision-making as well as the introduction of measures to reduce or abrogate the chain of transmission.real-time polymerase chain reaction it has been reported that real-time pcr is the gold standard molecular method for lab-based diagnosis of mpox.the real-time pcr workflow for mpox detection involves several key steps: denaturation, annealing, extension, and fluorescence readout. initially, the double-stranded dna is denatured to separate the strands into single strands, which facilitates the binding of primers to their respective target regions. the forward and reverse primers are designed to bind to specific sites on the single-stranded dna. the reverse primer plays a critical role in this process by binding to the complementary strand, enabling the synthesis of the complementary strand during the extension phase. during annealing, both the forward and reverse primers bind to their target sequences on the dna. following this, dna polymerase synthesises the complementary strand in the extension phase. the fluorescence signal is then released, allowing for real-time detection of the target sequence. regarding other tests involved, this real-time pcr assay specifically measures the amplification of target dna sequences, such as those within the g2r, b7r, b6r, n3r, and tnf receptor genes in the mpox virus genome, as previously reported.additionally, multiplex real-time pcr assays can be used to detect and differentiate various infectious agents and different subclades of the mpox virus.loop-mediated isothermal amplification real-time pcr is a standard technique method for diagnosing mpox infection; however, its shortcomings comprise sample processing time, constant availability of electricity supply, and technical skills.consequently, in terms of point of care, a user-friendly, simple, inexpensive, and rapid method for the laboratory diagnosis of mpox in low- to middle-income countries or areas with simple laboratory infrastructure are warranted. loop-mediated isothermal amplification is a recommended technique for the amplification of nucleic acid at a single and isothermal temperature of about °c – °c. while lamp requires less equipment than real-time pcr, it still relies on electricity, which may limit its utility in areas with inconsistent power supply. nevertheless, its simplicity and low-cost nature make it a valuable option for resource-limited settings.recombinase-based isothermal amplification assays recombinase-based isothermal amplification assays are also isothermal amplification methods involving enzyme-based dna amplification at a constant temperature of around °c to °c within min,and, because of its simplicity, high sensitivity, and rapidity, this method is suitable for point-of-care or field applicability for mpox detection. sensors sensors are also used in laboratory diagnosis based on their ability to respond to stimuli, biological, physical, and chemical agents that elicit observable effects that are measurable through electrochemistry, colourimetry, and fluorescence. their applications are simple, rapid, inexpensive, and adaptable for use in rural or less-resourced settings.in terms of the method, the rna sensors or toehold switches can stimulate the translation of a reporter gene, such as beta-galactosidase or a green fluorescent protein, against a receptor rna trigger sequence present in the sample. this results in the activation of a reporter protein, followed by a light reflection that generates an observable colour change. alternatively, fluorescence-based methods may use fluorescent dyes such as -carboxyfluorescein or sybr green to detect the presence of the target rna, generating a measurable fluorescence signal.prevention and control for effective control of mpox outbreaks, rapid recognition and investigation of new cases, along with a comprehensive understanding of all possible routes and modes of transmission, are essential strategies for vaccine distribution.prevention of transmission of the mpox virus principally depends on hygienic practices and restrictions on contact with wild animals as the primary transmission mode of the virus to humans.direct contact with an infected animal should be prevented to avoid the animal-to-human route. additionally, physical contact with other people who are infected should be avoided, personal protective equipment should be used to reduce transmission, and there should be isolation of patients with mild cases of the disease.in cases where a person presents with lesions caused by mpox around the genitals, sexual contact must be avoided, or condoms should be used to avoid transmission.although the majority of mpox cases during the outbreak occurred in men who have sex with men, the infection can affect individuals of all genders and age groups. during pregnancy, special precautions are necessary to prevent vertical transmission from mother to child through the placenta. additionally, perinatal transmission can be avoided by preventing neonatal contact with mpox-related genital lesions during childbirth.other avenues of transmission include tourism and travelling.hence, prevention and control of the mpox virus can also be affected by controlling international air travel volume and entrenching policies regarding entry into countries. deng et al.showed that a reduction in the volume of air travel and strict policies on border entry contributed to a reduction of mpox introductions of infected persons into china.smallpox vaccine has been shown to provide almost % protection against mpox because of herd immunity.pre- and post-prophylaxis vaccination has also been recommended by the healthcare authorities for healthcare workers, laboratory workers and technicians, response teams against outbreaks, as well as scientists who research clinical samples, and vaccinators.post-exposure prophylaxis is suggested when there has been unprotected contact with infected people or there has been sharing of close spaces with infected people for extended periods where there might be secretions of aerosols and the presence of the virus in the air particles.vaccines, antiviral agents, and drugs such as tecovirimat are used as the first line of treatment. challenges and future perspectives mpox prevention, treatment, and control face several challenges, including healthcare gaps and the limited availability of treatments, vaccinations, and resource environments.diagnostic challenges, such as access to advanced technologies, can hinder timely and accurate diagnosis.additionally, fever-like illnesses accompanied by a rash may be misdiagnosed as mpox.to effectively control mpox, strong public health systems are required to monitor and manage outbreaks, and trace contacts. however, underdeveloped systems in endemic areas make containment difficult.public mistrust of vaccines, especially in poorly literate areas, can impede mass vaccination campaigns. immunisation resistance, motivated by misleading information, remains a significant barrier.recommendations the following recommendations are of significance in the narratives concerning mpox: • global emergency preparedness to tackle the potential pandemic of the disease is critical and should be actioned. • training and re-training of healthcare professionals on the differential diagnosis and other intricate aspects of the disease. • enhanced research activities to uncover emerging clades and their genomes, more insights into their epidemiology, and genomic surveillance to identify changes and adjust vaccines should be prioritised. • increased provision of vaccines, especially to endemic areas to curb centrifugal spread, should be central to the strategies to tackle the disease. • increased allocation of resources by countries in a bid to contain the menace of the disease and its anticipated health burden. • development of simple screening and diagnostic test kits or methods especially for use in less-resourced countries. conclusion mpox is not a new disease, but an emerging and re-emerging disease caused, probably, by increased rates of zoonoses, deforestation, food insecurity, global mobility, and increased socialisation pressures. others include risky behaviours and decreased immunity to the smallpox virus, which shares cross-reactive antigenic determinants with the mpox virus, resulting in waning protection offered by herd immunity against mpox. the key drivers of infections across various age groups and countries over the past years were the various clades. the historical foci of the disease have been mainly in africa, in addition to reported cases in other continents, indicating varying degrees of morbidity and mortality in all affected countries. management of the disease may depend on the range of clinical manifestations, including the use of antivirals, and antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections. preventive and control measures are predicated on the isolation of patients, protective sexual intercourse, avoiding contact with fluids of infected persons, and vaccination, among others. laboratory diagnosis involves the use of pcr for routine purposes, but the use of serological tests should be interpreted with caution because of shared antigenicity among the orthopoxvirues. electron microscopy and genome sequencing are mainly for research-related endeavours.
mpox to update: a comprehensive review on its complications, transmission, diagnosis, and treatment abstract monkeypox virus is a zoonotic orthopoxvirus that has gained increased global attention due to recent outbreaks. the current review reports the latest update of mpox cases from february to april . it also evaluates the possible major complications in human life caused by mpox. in early more than countries reported mpox outbreaks. as of june the global case count for the –mpox outbreak was confirmed cases, in countries. the world health organization declared the mpox virus, a zoonotic disease, a public health emergency of international concern on august . mpox symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, and face-to-body rashes. the review also highlights mpox virus replication, genomics, pathology, transmission, diagnosis, and antiviral therapies. the outbreak is also discussed in detail. the coinfection of hiv in patients infected with mpox is also discussed. the evolving mpox epidemiology has raised concerns about the disease’s increasing spread in non-endemic countries, emphasizing the urgent need for control and prevention. the discussion on preventive measures, including vaccination, suggests that cross-protection against mpox may be possible using orthopoxvirus-specific antibodies. although there are no specific antiviral drugs available, certain drugs, such as tecovirimat, cidofovir, and ribavirin, are worth considering. . introduction monkeypox is a viral disease caused by the mpox virus. according to the latest report of the world health organization globally, confirmed cases of mpox have been reported from january to march . out of these, deaths were confirmed across countries. mpox virus is an enveloped double-stranded dna with around kb of nucleotides, which is brick-shaped and has a tubule-like structure on its surface. additionally, it has a dumbbell-shaped core structure that measures up to to nm. this virus belongs to the genus orthopoxvirus and the family of poxviridae. mpox resembles smallpox, and the disease is spread via zoonosis. there are two clades of mpox: clade i and clade ii. both have a sequence similarity of about %. the fatality rate of clade i is three times higher than that of clade ii. mpox has a linear dna genome that contains around non-overlapping open reading frames. mpox genomes contain a highly conserved central region, while the terminal region is highly variable, having inverted terminal repeats. all mpox viruses have four orfs in the itr region. the gene loss at the terminal region acts as a driving force for the evolution of the new mpox. the ultrastructural analysis study in revealed that virus replication occurs in the mini-nucleus, which is reorganized by endoplasmic reticulum cisternae in the host cell. the early mrna and late mrna form in the mini nucleus, which consecutively form the early protein and the late protein. as a result, an intracellular mature virus is released in the cytoplasm and comes outside of the cell by exocytosis to form an enveloped extracellular virus or extracellular mature virus, which is ready to infect another host cell. mpox is not considered a sexually transmitted disease, although the mpox virus dna was detected in semen and seminal fluid samples in italy and germany in the global outbreak. despite various studies on the mpox virus, the anal or vaginal route can be considered a mucosal membrane route. virus mutation and the re-emergence of pathogens with unusual transmission routes may enhance infection and increase the possibility of an epidemic. since two major mpox outbreaks have prompted the world health organization to declare public health emergencies of international concern, first in july and again in august . the initial global spread, attributed to a clade 2b strain, resulted in roughly cases and fatalities. subsequently, a new clade, 1b, emerged, leading to a second surge. as of december this recent outbreak has seen over reported or suspected cases and approximately deaths, primarily in the democratic republic of congo and neighboring nations such as burundi, rwanda, uganda, and angola. isolated cases of clade 1b have also been documented in countries including the uk, sweden, germany, belgium, france, the usa, canada, and thailand. the details of the outbreaks of and are as follows. .. the outbreak the mpox clade 1b variant, initially detected in the sud kivu area of the democratic republic of congo, has emerged as a major public health threat due to its increased ability to spread between people. genetic investigation of clade 1b has uncovered numerous mutations of mpox. the genetic makeup of clade 1b shows several mutations in genes related to the enzyme apolipoprotein b mrna editing catalytic polypeptide-like cytosine deaminase. this enzyme’s involvement is often indicative of sustained human-to-human transmission. these genetic alterations distinguish clade 1b from the traditionally circulating clade i variant, enabling more efficient spread through close physical contact, including sexual contact. genetic changes, particularly those linked to apobec3, are thought to contribute to clade 1b’s enhanced transmissibility. since its initial identification, this variant has expanded its reach within the drc to other provinces and has also been reported in neighboring nations like rwanda, uganda, and kenya, signifying a considerable geographical expansion of the outbreak. the democratic republic of congo was the epicenter and reported mpox infections and deaths as of august . the emergence of the clade 1b mpox in neighboring central and east african countries has raised significant concerns about the potential for a wider regional epidemic. burundi had recorded mpox alerts by august and were confirmed positive for the clade ib mpox variant. rwanda confirmed its initial two mpox infections on july prompting the ministry of health to declare an outbreak on july . by august rwanda had reported a total of four confirmed cases of the clade 1b variant of mpox, with no associated deaths. in uganda, initially, six suspected cases were identified in june and out of those six, two were confirmed later. as of august kenya has identified suspected cases, with one confirmed positive for clade ib mpox. to date, no deaths have been reported. in august the clade 1b strain’s spread beyond africa was confirmed for the first time. the virus has also extended its reach to countries in east africa, europe, and asia, underscoring its capacity for worldwide spread. sweden reported a case involving a traveler returning from an affected region, demonstrating the pivotal role of international travel in spreading infectious diseases globally. this event prompted urgent calls for governments to enhance border checks, implement targeted surveillance, and foster international collaboration to control cross-border disease transmission. on august thailand reported its initial mpox case of a european man with a recent travel history to africa. likewise, india’s identification of its first imported clade 1b mpox case in kerala highlights the potential for international travel to contribute to the dissemination of this variant. from november to february four cases of clade ib were detected. in the united states, the first confirmed case of clade ib mpox occurred in california in november following travel to an affected region. a second case was identified in georgia on january involving a traveler from a country with ongoing mpox transmission. subsequent cases were reported in new hampshire on february and in new york on february . these four cases represent independent events, with no epidemiological links established and no evidence of further transmission. the outbreak emphasized the importance of aligning travel health policies with robust outbreak management strategies to minimize risks from rapidly spreading pathogens. a significant public health crisis unfolded between and december with global records documenting over mpox infections. between and the different regions of the americas documented confirmed mpox cases, resulting in deaths across countries and territories. the majority of these cases occurred in followed by a substantial decline in . a minor increase was observed in with cases. the world health organization has determined that the highly contagious clade 1b strain is the primary driver of this outbreak, characterized by severe symptoms and increased mortality. the most affected areas that reported a large number of infections were east, central, west, and southern africa, specifically, burundi, kenya, rwanda, uganda, the central african republic, ivory coast, and south africa. the swift dissemination of the virus in these areas underscores the critical need for collaborative containment efforts and enhanced healthcare systems to effectively address such epidemics. .. the outbreak before mpox cases were documented within the african continent. the first case of the outbreak of the mpox outside the african continent was recorded on may in the united kingdom. a total of mpox cases were confirmed in the united kingdom until june . on may portugal reported mpox infections, spain reported seven, and canada reported . the first mpox cases in belgium, sweden, and italy were confirmed on may . france, germany, australia, and the netherlands each reported their initial mpox cases on may . switzerland and israel each confirmed their initial mpox cases on may . by may countries had reported cases of mpox. among these, the united arab emirates identified its first case in late may, involving a -year-old female traveler from west africa. slovenia also confirmed its initial infection. denmark’s first case was linked to an individual returning from the canary islands. in canada, quebec reported fifteen confirmed cases on may, the same day the czech republic confirmed its first case. the study published in the new england journal on july reported a total of mpox infections between april and june at sites within countries. by may portugal had confirmed mpox cases, and the information regarding demographics, clinical presentation, and exposure was collected from all cases via face-to-face and telephone interviews using standardized case investigation forms. a subset of confirmed cases underwent more detailed investigation, and their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, along with available laboratory and epidemiological findings, are summarized in a previous study published in eurosurveillance in june . the majority of cases of the portugal outbreak resided in the lisbon and tagus valley region, with single cases in the north and algarve regions. all cases were male, ages ranging from to years. considering exposures within the days preceding symptom onset, few reported contact with individuals exhibiting similar symptoms, and some had a history of international travel. most cases were identified as men who have sex with men, while one reported sex with only women. during the days before symptom onset, most cases with available data reported multiple sexual partners. six cases reported attending a sauna in the lvt region, one frequented a uk sauna, and four reported international travel—three reported contacts with animals. common symptoms included exanthema, inguinal lymphadenopathy, fever, and genital ulcers. fourteen cases were hiv-positive. three cases required hospitalization, two of whom were later discharged. no deaths were reported by may . one middle-aged case reported prior smallpox vaccination. in may the world health organization declared a global health emergency for a previous mpox outbreak caused by clade iib of the virus. almost cases of mpox were reported from different regions of latin america, such as brazil, argentina, peru, venezuela, mexico, colombia, and chile, by june . in july the multi-country mpox outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern due to its rapid spread through sexual contact in regions previously unaffected by the virus. this declaration was lifted in may following a sustained global decline in cases. the outbreak had infected people and resulted in deaths. the who attributed the successful containment to a combination of vaccination and public health information campaigns. most of these countries have set up their epidemiological centers for the identification of these viruses. according to the centers for disease control and prevention, as of february the maximum number of reported cases in the usa is followed by brazil, spain, and france. the geographical distribution of the mpox in countries affected in africa is illustrated in figure 2a, while the recent trends of mpox cases in africa are shown in figure 2b. . host reservoirs and transmission mpox is a zoonotic disease; central african rodents and primates are the natural hosts of mpox. the mpox virus is primarily transmitted from animals to humans through close contact, such as bites, scratches, or exposure to the animal’s rash, as well as through exposure to their bodily fluids or consumption of improperly cooked meat. transmission can also occur via contaminated materials like bedding or clothing. historically, human-to-human transmission has been less frequent. a case study reported that a man traveling from nigeria to the uk on september 6th presented with a maculopapular rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy and was subsequently diagnosed with mpox. one of the three attending healthcare workers developed symptoms, was isolated, and had contacts traced and monitored. four of these contacts later became ill. this incident demonstrates human-to-human transmission of mpox from a traveler returning from nigeria to healthcare staff. historically, mpox infection was primarily linked to animal contact or travel to endemic regions. however, the transmission pattern shifted in the outbreak, with most cases now attributed to sexual contact. over the last two years, predominantly gay and bisexual men have been affected. the study reveals that the risk of public transmission was very low because mpox virus transmission from human to human requires close contact. human-to-human transmission of the mpox virus occurred through direct contact through blood transfusion, respiratory droplet infection, sharing of foods, clothes, and bedding, and sexual activity, especially with male-to-male sex. the mpox virus may be transmitted from the mother to the fetus during pregnancy, and that type of transmission is called vertical transmission. the different proposed model admits that during the entry of the mpox virus through the respiratory epithelium in humans, the mpox virus enters dendritic cells and macrophages, which then enter lymphatic vessels and the lymphatic system. in the same way, when the mpox virus infects the skin epidermis, it first infects fibroblast cells and langerhans cells, which move in lymphatic vessels and then into the lymphatic system. in this way, it spreads all over the body and infects the liver, which may cause serious liver problems. . complications associated with mpox the various complications that have been observed in mpox-infected persons are the following. .. neurological and psychiatric complications mpox infections are associated with potential neurological and mental health complications. research conducted in nigeria in indicated that a quarter of hospitalized mpox patients experienced psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. however, it is difficult to isolate these symptoms from the psychological impact of hospitalization and isolation. neurological issues, including seizures, confusion, and encephalitis, were observed in mpox patients during the outbreak, with reported occurrences of .%, .%, and %, respectively. furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed the presence of mpox-specific igm antibodies. studies indicate that neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in % of individuals with mpox infection. badenoch and colleagues suggest that symptoms occur in more than half of cases. these symptoms may arise from the infection itself or the experience of quarantine. additionally, research conducted in iraq has revealed widespread anxiety among the general population concerning the ongoing mpox outbreak. this research sought to evaluate public awareness, perceptions, and anxiety related to the multi-country mpox outbreak within the kurdistan region of iraq. a digital survey utilizing a convenience sampling approach was conducted from to july . the study included participants. overall, the population demonstrated a moderate understanding of mpox, held a neutral attitude toward it, and experienced a moderate level of anxiety. statistical analysis revealed that demographic factors, including gender, religion, education level, and place of residence, significantly impacted awareness and anxiety levels. gender and the residential area also played a significant role in shaping attitudes toward mpox. .. dermatological complications a common characteristic of mpox infection is the appearance of skin lesions, particularly in the anogenital region. skin lesions present as a rash that progresses through distinct stages: initially flat, then raised, and subsequently fluid-filled. these lesions typically resolve with crusting within three weeks. a characteristic mpox rash begins with small, flat or raised lesions, typically .to cm in diameter. these lesions progress over two to three weeks, evolving into fluid-filled vesicles and pus-filled pustules, often with a central depression, and eventually form crusts. the vesicles and pustules themselves are generally spherical, ranging from .to cm in diameter, and are notable for their firm texture, deep skin involvement, and well-defined edges. a hallmark of mpox is a unique rash characterized by painful or itchy maculopapular lesions that progress into a vesiculopustular eruption. typically, the rash emerges within one to three days following the onset of initial symptoms. however, variations exist, with some individuals experiencing the rash more than three days after fever onset or concurrently with the fever. lesions commonly manifest on the face, trunk, extremities, genital region, scalp, palms, and soles. the rash often begins on the face and then spreads outward to the limbs, palms, soles, and mucous membranes of the mouth, eyes, and genitals. a higher concentration of lesions is generally observed on the face and limbs. in some cases, oral lesions, known as enanthems, may precede the appearance of the skin rash. a comprehensive review of available research indicates that sore throat is the most frequently reported oral symptom of mpox, while ulceration is the most common oral or peri-oral sign. in one study of patients, all presented with skin lesions, with a significant majority exhibiting anogenital involvement. a large portion of these patients reported lesions at multiple anatomical sites, and a smaller percentage had lesions in the oropharyngeal area. additionally, a substantial number of patients experienced fatigue and fever, while a minority showed no initial symptoms. in some cases, genital ulcers were observed to be painless, accompanied by bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy, resembling the presentation of primary syphilis. a separate international study, tracking mpox infections in also identified anogenital lesions as a prevalent symptom. this study found that % of patients had anogenital lesions, and % presented with mucosal lesions. a rash was observed in % of patients, with other frequently reported symptoms including fever, lymphadenopathy, lethargy, muscle aches, and headaches. due to the varied and evolving clinical presentation of mpox, especially as seen in the outbreak, medical professionals, particularly dermatologists, are advised to exercise a high degree of vigilance when evaluating patients with suspected mpox infection. the other study, conducted in patients from thirteen countries, shows that % of cases have been found with skin lesions. during the initial five days of infection, papules, vesicles, and pustules were the most frequently observed skin lesions. from days –pustules became the dominant lesion, followed by erosions/ulcers and crusts/scabs. after day crusts/scabs were the primary skin manifestation. while monkeypox treatment remains largely symptomatic due to the lack of specific antiviral medications, a novel therapeutic approach combining antimicrobial photodynamic therapy and photobiomodulation therapy successfully treated a large facial cutaneous lesion, highlighting its potential as a promising intervention. .. complications related to the coinfection of mpox virus and hiv the covid-pandemic, which began in demonstrated the rapid emergence of viral diseases and the potential for global spread, highlighting the ongoing threat of mpox. mpox may be more lethal for immunocompromised people, such as those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. the coinfection of mpox virus and hiv was first identified and diagnosed in latin america. in the recent coinfection of mpox and acute hiv was also confirmed in a -year-old male with outstretched papules throughout the trunk, face, and genital area. a review in vaccine reported confirmed mpox cases across studies, with a .% hiv co-infection rate. according to who, % of confirmed cases of mpox have hiv. the outbreak of mpox in multiple countries was reported during –. according to the who report, the maximum number of confirmed cases came from the european region, followed by america, the african region, and the eastern mediterranean region. co-infection with hiv increases the chance of infection in an uninfected person by enhancing the concentration of hiv on genital organs and genital secretions or by increasing both factors. individuals living with hiv, especially those with compromised immune systems characterized by low cd4 cell counts, demonstrate an increased vulnerability to severe mpox complications and mortality compared to those without hiv. the immunodeficiency resulting from advanced hiv infection elevates the susceptibility to severe mpox manifestations, which can include necrotizing skin lesions, pulmonary involvement, secondary infections, and sepsis. this study analysed mpox cases, comprising cisgender males, four cisgender females, and ten transgender females. the median age of the participants was years, with an interquartile range of to years. at the time of mpox diagnosis, individuals were known to be living with hiv. among those with hiv, were adhering to antiretroviral therapy. concurrent opportunistic infections were observed in participants. the median cd4 cell count was cells/mm3. specifically, individuals had cd4 counts below cells/mm3, and individuals had counts between and cells/mm3. an undetectable viral load was present in participants. severe mpox complications were significantly more prevalent in individuals with cd4 counts below cells/mm3 compared to those with counts exceeding cells/mm3. these complications included the following: necrotizing skin lesions, pulmonary involvement, sometimes with nodules, and secondary infections and sepsis. hospitalization was required for participants, with of those hospitalized resulting in death. all fatalities occurred in individuals with cd4 counts below cells/mm3. within this group, mortality was higher among those with elevated hiv viral loads. immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome related to mpox was suspected in of the individuals who initiated or restarted art, with of these cases resulting in death. tecovirimat was administered to participants, while cidofovir or brincidofovir was used in seven participants. tecovirimat resistance was confirmed in three cases. .. complications associated with heart myocarditis, pericarditis, and myopericarditis have been rarely documented in mpox infection. two immunocompetent, unvaccinated adults in the u.s. developed monkeypox-related myocarditis. they were hospitalized and presented with cardiac symptoms and elevated biomarkers. oral tecovirimat and doxycycline were provided for the treatment of monkeypox, and they were discharged home after recovery without immediate complications. they received no specific treatment for myocarditis, given the rapid resolution of symptoms and normalization of troponin levels. in a study, thornhill et al. documented two instances of self-limiting myocarditis associated with monkeypox, where patients recovered within seven days without significant complications. one of these patients had a history of hiv with a normal cd4 count. a wide range of viruses are known to cause myocarditis, such as coxsackieviruses and adenoviruses. viral myocarditis can cause dilated cardiomyopathy. the most frequently observed pathological process involves lymphocytic myocarditis with myocyte necrosis, typically developing to days after the viral infection. the occurrence of myocardial involvement in orthopoxvirus infections was initially documented following smallpox vaccination in young military recruits, using live vaccinia-based vaccines. the precise pathophysiological pathways leading to orthopox-induced myocarditis remain to be determined. heart failure, arrhythmias, and other cardiovascular-related problems may also be possible in mpox infection. .. hypotension sepsis complication in severe cases, significant fluid loss due to fever, rash, and capillary permeability can occur. the associated systemic inflammatory response may also contribute to hypotension. these factors combine to reduce renal perfusion, potentially leading to acute kidney injury. vigilant monitoring of urine output and blood chemistry is essential for early detection and to guide the necessity of intravenous fluid replacement. while infrequent, secondary bacterial infections leading to sepsis have been documented in mpox-infected patients with streptococcus pyogenes. prompt identification of sepsis, utilizing standard diagnostic criteria, is essential. treatment should adhere to established sepsis management protocols, including initiating broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics within one hour of diagnosis, rapid intravenous fluid resuscitation with ongoing response evaluation, vasoactive medication administration, and appropriate respiratory support. .. ocular complication ocular symptoms are uncommon but can cause corneal scarring and vision loss. manifestations, potentially from self-inoculation, include conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and other ocular inflammations. the mpox outbreak showed a significantly lower ocular involvement rate of approximately %, compared to –% in prior outbreaks. mpox can present with a variety of ocular symptoms, including redness, frontal headaches, rashes around the eyes, tearing, discharge, and subconjunctival nodules. less commonly, it may lead to more severe complications like keratitis, corneal ulcers, opacification, perforation, and vision loss. in the outbreak, these ocular symptoms have been observed less often and potentially with reduced severity. though potential underreporting exists, observational studies suggest an ocular involvement rate of approximately %, significantly lower than the –% incidence reported in previous outbreaks in endemic regions. newborns have been reported to experience ocular involvement with mpox. additionally, there are documented cases where ocular symptoms presented independently, without concurrent skin lesions. patients presenting with ocular mpox symptoms should be referred for ophthalmologic evaluation. a slit-lamp examination and dilated fundoscopy are valuable tools for assessing the involvement of both anterior and posterior eye structures. retinol supplementation is advised. supportive measures such as eye lubrication and saline compresses may provide relief. in cases of co-infection, ophthalmic antibiotics or antivirals may be necessary. patients should be instructed to avoid contact lens use. topical trifluridine, under ophthalmological guidance, can be considered for conjunctivitis and is recommended for keratitis management. .. fulminant mpox a severe, widespread, and destructive form of mpox has been observed in individuals with advanced immunosuppression, such as those with cd4 counts below cells/µl, high hiv viral loads, or hepatitis b co-infection. these cases show a resemblance to an aids-defining illness. patients showed extensive, large necrotic skin and mucosal lesions that often merged. severe secondary bacterial infections were frequent. complications included lung nodules, necrotic pulmonary masses, nodular hepatic lesions, respiratory insufficiency, and sepsis. immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome was suspected in a quarter of patients initiating or resuming antiretroviral therapy post-diagnosis. mortality was reported in % of patients, primarily those with cd4 counts below cells/µl. in moderately to severely immunocompromised patients with uncontrolled viral dissemination, optimal immune function should be prioritized. tecovirimat should be initiated promptly, and consider adding cido
