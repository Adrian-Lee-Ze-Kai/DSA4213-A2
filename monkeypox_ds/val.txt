mmunised macaques developed severe and grave disease which was, however, attenuated compared to control animals. morbidity was quantified by lesion counts, viral burden in blood and in the throat, weight development and disease duration. with all criteria, mrna achieved superior protection over mva vaccination. the mrna vaccine induced a higher clade i and ii mpxv nab titre than mva immunisation. the mrna vaccine also induced better fc‐functional activities than mva. cellular immune responses were not measured in this study. as the mrna vaccine also reduced the viral titre in throat swabs, one might even expect a vaccination effect on viral transmission and not only on disease prevention. a clinical trial is underway. another study in rhesus monkeys compared the efficacy of mva, acam2000 or ad35 vector–based vaccines, expressing l1/b5 or l1/b5/a27/a33 mpxv proteins, against an intravenous challenge with a high dose of clade iib mpxv. all vaccines provided protection, but to various degrees. acam2000 mediated complete protection, while mva and the adenovirus‐vectored vaccine only conferred incomplete protection. protection correlated with nab titers. passive immunisation a report from 2005 demonstrated that macaques which received an immunoglobulin preparation from recently vaccinated subjects were protected from lethal challenge with mpxv, but they still developed skin lesions, increasing in number with decreasing nab titers. no protection was achieved in this animal model with normal immunoglobulin preparations. another group developed monoclonal antibodies against the vacv b5 antigen, which displayed vacv neutralising activity and protected mice against a lethal challenge with vacv, but viral load was only moderately decreased compared to controls. us researchers developed 89 mabs from immune human subjects. half of them displayed in vitro neutralising activity and many were cross‐reactive against several orthopoxviruses, including mpxv. however, most individual mabs reduced viral plaque numbers by only 70%. it needed a mixture of six mabs to achieve a good in vivo protective activity in mice challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of vacv. prophylactic application of this mab mixture achieved a 106‐fold reduction of the virus load in lungs, and all treated mice survived. in immunodeficient mice, the mab mixture achieved a sterilising immunity and assured a 100% survival. a human subject vaccinated against smallpox yielded two mabs, which bound distinct epitopes on mpxv b6 protein. upon intraperitoneal injection, these two mabs protected vacv‐challenged mice against weight loss and modestly reduced lung titers by tenfold compared to controls. a combination of two mabs directed against protein d8 and a33 found on mv and ev, respectively, protected mice from mpxv‐induced mortality and morbidity when given up to 3 days after viral challenge. antivirals tecovirimat binds the peripheral membrane protein f13 of ev, which is conserved across orthopoxviruses. f13 elicits production of wrapped virions, an intermediate step of intracellular virus maturation. the antivirals cidofovir and brincidofovir target the dna polymerase of orthopoxviruses. these three drugs inhibited diverse mpxv isolates from the 2022 epidemic in cell culture at concentrations that were achieved after oral dosing in humans. in vitro inhibition was observed for clade ia, ib, iia and iib mpxvs. a few tecovirimat‐resistant mpxv mutants have been described in immunocompromised mpox patients that were treated for extended periods. however, these mutants were not seen in clade ib isolates and only with low frequency in clade iib isolates. macaques infected intravenously with a lethal dose of mpxv and treated at days 4 or 5 with tecovirimat showed 100% survival when treated with 3 mg drug/kg body weight. with further treatment delay to day 6 after viral inoculation, the survival rate dropped to 50%. five daily tecovirimat doses were associated with higher survival than three daily doses. the trial was conducted under fda's animal efficacy rule for the treatment of smallpox. in a safety evaluation with 452 human subjects treated twice daily for 14 days with 600 mg tecovirimat, adverse events were observed with similar frequency as in the placebo group. tecovirimat was approved by fda to treat smallpox and can be used for mpox under an expanded‐access investigational new drug protocol. in a us study, 13 patients with advanced hiv who experienced severe mpox were treated with an extended tecovirimat course. despite treatment, they experienced prolonged hospitalisation and high mortality. notably, half of the patients showed a viral mutation that may indicate tecovirimat resistance. in the us, tecovirimat was prescribed under ea‐ind for over 7100 patients with painful anogenital lesions during the 2022/3 mpox epidemic. for 1600 patients an outcome was documented, but since they were not part of a clinical trial, neither safety nor efficacy could be demonstrated. two recent controlled trials were conducted with tecovirimat. the stomp trial, which enrolled msm patients from four continents with clade ii mpxv infections during the worldwide mpox epidemic, was stopped for futility after 75% of the targeted patients were enrolled, and no treatment effect could be documented. the palm007 trial enrolled 600 children and adults with clade i mpox disease from drc. tecovirimat treatment had no effect on time to healing of skin lesions, virus levels in blood, skin lesions and importantly, no effect on mortality, which was 1.7% in both the treatment and placebo groups. not much evidence exists for the efficacy of other drugs against mpxv infection. brincidofovir showed a modest survival effect in prairie dogs intranasally challenged with a lethal dose of mpxv. when the drug was given before or together with the challenge virus, half of the animals survived; when given 1 day after infection, only 25% of the animals survived compared with 10% in the placebo group. otherwise, two cases of severe disseminated mpox infection in renal transplant recipients were successfully treated with brincidofovir. antiviral research against mpxv clearly needs new compounds targeting distinct viral proteins. german researchers conducted a multi‐omics analysis of the transcriptome, proteome, and phosphor‐proteome signatures of mpxv‐infected primary human fibroblasts to identify new targets. they identified perturbations of immune‐related pathways and changes in the dynamic phosphorylation of both host and viral proteins. these infection‐elicited molecular fingerprints identified nearly 700 drug targets. based on these insights, they selected 52 drugs. as a proof‐of‐concept drug target validation screen, they tested these drugs in cell culture for an attenuated mpxv cytopathic effect, for growth inhibition of a vacv reporter and for reduction in mpxv mrna accumulation. they identified two candidate antiviral compounds. interestingly, tecovirimat, while reducing the amount of released virus, did not inhibit intracellular viral mrna accumulation or cytopathic effects. political considerations the who's contingency fund for emergencies released us$ 1.45 million for fighting mpox, with more to come with the pheic declaration. commentators in a leading medical journal judged these funding levels insufficient to support a robust emergency response. the mpox continental preparedness and response plan for africa, co‐led by who and africa cdc, formulated 10 pillars of action. it pledged financial resources but for a timely implementation an increased african leadership is pivotal for success. likewise, when the who declared a second pheic for mpox, japan has pledged up to 3.6 million doses of its lc16m8 vaccine, and the european union agreed to distribute 200,000 doses while the us offered just 50,000 vaccine doses. however, even when taking japan's pledges at face value, this still falls short of the demand for 10 million vaccine doses expressed by the africa cdc. when resources are limited, decisions by local public health and political authorities are needed. model calculations showed that vaccinating 80% of all children younger than 5 years in endemic regions such as drc could lead to a 27% reduction in cases and a 43% reduction in deaths, but still require 10 million vaccine doses. some lessons from the covid‐19 pandemic have apparently not been learned. for example, african countries still lack the resources to track the disease, the facilities to make their own vaccines, and a regulatory infrastructure in the form of an african medicines agency. pheics are by definition a global threat to health that needs a coordinated response from leaders everywhere. a response includes the training of health workers, the organisation of genomic and epidemiological surveillance, conducting clinical trials, the development of diagnostic tools, and monitoring of animal reservoirs. much fewer viral genome sequences have been determined for clade i mpxv from africa than for clade ii in the northern hemisphere, which hampers the delineation of viral variants and the design of containment measures, which are most efficient when implemented within 100 days after an outbreak. after a pandemic such as covid‐19, people are all too eager to forget their painful experiences. psychologically, it might be understandable to suppress past pandemic experiences to maintain an optimistic view into the future. rationally, this is not a helpful attitude. not learning the lessons from a past painful experience and taking appropriate actions accordingly means risking living again the same painful experiences. denying scientific evidence is self‐harming. the covid‐19 pandemic has revealed not only a loss of rationality in substantial parts of our societies but also a flood of health misinformation and deliberate disinformation. as the lancet wrote, health misinformation was weaponised as propaganda, exploiting fear, undermining public trust, and hindering collective action in critical moments. it became a deliberate instrument to attack and discredit scientists and health professionals for political gains. while who encourages responsible communication and flags misleading content, social media such as meta has decided to drop fact checking. deliberate disinformation on both classical and social media is extensively and increasingly used by authoritarian regimes to subvert liberal democracies. to this attack comes now the downsizing of the very institutions we need for fighting the spread of epidemics by the current trump administration. the us withdrawal from who, the dismantling of usaid, the mass lay‐offs at cdc, the freezing of research money at nih, and the intention of the new us health secretary to instruct the nih to take ‘a break’ from infectious diseases, all these measures are serious blows for pandemic preparedness. while one might still understand the unwillingness of us taxpayers to support fragile and underfunded health systems run by african governments, which in addition foster epidemic spread by wars, such political decisions in affluent societies are shortsighted since epidemics do not know frontiers. even large oceans are no physical barriers to epidemic spread as dramatically seen for west nile virus epidemic, covid‐19, the 2022/3 mpox epidemic and the avian influenza epidemic, which all had major impacts in the us. sadly, the current us government follows chaotic decisions even when the interests of us citizens are at stake, as in the avian flu/dairy cattle epidemic ongoing in the us. usda must now try to rehire scientists for an avian flu response who were just fired to cut governmental costs. viral epidemics are increasing in frequency. this is now the worst moment to upset public health institutions such as cdc, which were the envy of the world. cdc websites were taken down and a prime source of public health information such as cdc's mmwr failed to appear for political pressure, which has not happened in 60 years. scientists and doctors must stem this erosion of public health and infectious diseases research in the us. the us government deliberately renounces being the leader of science in general and in infectious diseases research, in particular. european countries must try to fill this void created by the current us administration. the european countries have now realised that they must stand on their own feet and spend hundreds of billions of euros on defence. scientists in europe should lobby that defence does not only mean to withstand the military threat of dictatorial systems but that defence should also include protection of their populations from future pandemic threats. if a fraction of the planned defence budgets is taken to fight infectious diseases, a lot can be done and would also facilitate acceptance of the huge defence budgets by european peaceniks as well as stimulate the soft power of the eu. author contributions harald

mpox: an emerging or re-emerging infection with a potential colossal burden on healthcare globally abstract the world health organization identified mpox, as a resurgent zoonotic epidemic caused by the mpox virus. it is an emerging and re-emerging pathogen with a range of hosts and geographical distribution worldwide. peer-reviewed scientific articles from 1958 to 29 august 2024 related to global mpox research were extracted from web of sciencetm core collection and google scholar databases to gauge the extent of the infection. mpox is marked by a recent resurgence of infections across continents, with africa being the hardest-hit region. the mpox re-emergence has shown a new mechanism of transmission, with several causes such as a rise in the number of unvaccinated individuals, behaviour risk factors, waning immunity, genetic evolution, and environmental circumstances. preventive and control measures of mpox include vaccination and patient isolation, while treatment involves antivirals and antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections. laboratory diagnosis entailing polymerase chain reaction can be effective for routine purposes, but results of serological tests must be interpreted with caution, because of cross-reacting determinants among orthopoxviruses. the structure and classification of the mpox virus, clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, epidemiology, historical antecedent, therapeutics, vaccines, and laboratory diagnosis of the disease are explicated, showcasing mpox as an emerging or re-emerging infection with a potential colossal burden on healthcare, and its classification as an international public health emergency by the world health organization. what this study adds this review provides the global situation of mpox as an emerging or re-emerging infection, warranting its designation as an international public health emergency. introduction mpox, formerly known as monkeypox by the world health organization, is a zoonotic viral infection with a cycle of transmission involving the active participation of wild animals.1 the mpox virus is regarded as both an emerging and a re-emerging pathogen with a varied range of hosts.2 the re-emergence of the mpox virus version with enhanced virulence since its first identification and reporting in monkeys in 1958 is favoured by the alterations in the virus genome resulting from mutations.2 although mpox was identified 70 years ago, it has been ignored in medical literature because of its rarity.3 however, it has recently been accorded much attention because of a trail of morbidity and mortality in different age groups worldwide, although its foci were mainly in africa.2,4 the mpox name is likely to have originated from the fact that mpox was initially identified in monkeys from singapore used for research purposes in 1958 and then transported to copenhagen in denmark.3,5,6 mpox is caused by a diverse and large group of orthopoxviruses7 and is characterised by symptoms that resonate with those of smallpox and chickenpox, even though mpox usually presents milder symptoms compared to smallpox and has a 10% fatality rate in people who are not vaccinated against smallpox.3 mpox is a viral disease that has been added to the who list of communicable diseases by viruses with the possibility for widespread and epidemic repercussions and fears after the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, hence its classification as an international public health emergency.8,9,10 by 29 august 2024, a total of 89 596 established cases of mpox had been recorded across 114 countries, with 157 deaths,11 resulting in apprehension regarding the geographic spread.12 even though the exact causes and reasons for the re-emergence of mpox are unknown, it is postulated that it could be a result of several factors, such as the increase in the number of people not vaccinated against smallpox, risk factors of behaviours of men having sex with other men, decreasing immunity, genetic evolution, and ecological conditions.11 the global spread of the disease is a health hazard.13 additionally, the recent disease modelling proposes that pandemics which are usually caused by emerging diseases are expected to surge in severity and frequency in the upcoming decades.14 hence, the review aims to report on mpox as an emerging or re-emerging infection with a potential colossal burden on healthcare. methods on 29 august 2024, peer-reviewed scientific articles related to global mpox research were extracted from the web of sciencetm core collection and google scholar databases. the search included papers from 1958 to 29 august 2024, and included phrases associated with mpox, monkeypox virus, mpox classification and structure, mpox epidemiology, mpox vaccines, and mpox laboratory diagnosis. in every study that was retrieved, only english-language literature was included. classification and structure of the mpox virus classification of mpox virus the mpox virus belongs to the poxviridae family, which comprises 22 genera and 83 species.15 the family is subdivided into two subfamilies, namely chordopoxvirinae, with 52 species and 18 genera, and entomopoxvarinae, with 31 species and 4 genera. twelve members of the genus orthopoxvirus have been recognised to affect both humans and animals.15,16 the variola virus is the commonly known member that causes smallpox, while others are known as the cowpox virus, camelpox virus, skunkpox virus, volepox virus, taterapox virus, akhmeta virus, abatino macacapox virus, raccoonpox virus, vaccinia virus, ectromelia virus, and mpox virus.15,16 structure of mpox virus and its genome the lipoprotein outer membrane of the mpox enveloped virus is oval or brick-shaped.17 the normal size of the mpox virus varies from 200 nm to 250 nm, with a double-stranded dna genome of almost 197.2 kb, and encodes 181 proteins.18 the hairpin end of the linear genome is covalently closed and there are no free 3’ or 5’ ends.18 the genome ends consist of the 10 kb inverted terminal repeats and nucleotide homopolymers. however, short tandem repeats have been observed in the genome.18 orthologous poxvirus genes are closely packed, and intergenic areas that are 100 bp in length are uncommon.18,19 the ‘housekeeping’ proteins that are encoded by orthologous poxvirus genes in the conserved central area are responsible for transcription, replication, and virion processes. in the terminal domains, the proteins encoded by orthologous poxvirus genes are linked to the pathogenesis and host range.19,20 the mpox virus consists of two main clades: clade i, formally identified as the congo basin clade, and clade ii, formally recognised as the west africa clade.21,22 these clades are split into two subclades, namely clade ia and clade ib in clade i, and clade iia and clade iib in clade ii.21,22 lately, clade iii, consisting of hmpox-1 a, b.1, a.1.1, a.1, and a.2, has been reported in non-african countries, including mexico.22,23,24 clade iii varies primarily in regions of coding and is linked to the host’s recognition of antigenic determining factors and immune modulation.25 a total of 46 single-nucleotide polymorphisms are reported from clade iii.23,26 the mutation of mpox is because of the action of the apolipoprotein b mrna editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide 3 family of cytosine deaminases.27 pathogenesis and pathophysiology of mpox virus viral endocytosis, cell membrane fusion, and micropinocytosis accelerate viral transmission through oropharyngeal, subcutaneous, nasopharyngeal intramuscular, and intradermal pathways.28 the virus replicates at the location of inoculation, which leads to the virus spreading to different organs of the lymph nodes, blood, bone marrow, tonsils, and spleen, triggering inflammatory immune-mediated phagocytosis.29,30 this signifies the period of incubation, which usually lasts for 7 days to 21 days. through the guidance of the enveloped and mature virions, the genome and proteins of the mpox virus are discharged into host cells. intracellular mature virions encompassing the dna encoding the virus get generated when the virus mrna transcription and translation occurs.31,32 intracellular mature virions enfolded in the golgi apparatus fuse with the host inner cell membrane to form cell-related virions before being released into extracellular areas to produce extracellular enveloped virions.29 the mpox virus can be spread in different modes from animals to humans, or humans to humans. however, the general mode is through human contact with the bodily fluids of the infected animals.33,34,35 the distinction between mpox and smallpox is that mpox virus infection triggers lymphadenopathy in humans while smallpox does not. the early symptoms of mpox virus infection are muscle aches, headache, diarrhoea, fever, chills, vomiting, fatigue, and backache, which advance to fatigue, developing into secondary bacterial infections of the skin or blood and lung infections.21 the body of the infected person can be affected by lesions that are initiated in the oropharynx, and inflammation of the heart, brain or other organs can also occur.36,37 moreover, patients can also have neurological concerns in the form of encephalitis.36 the onset symptoms occur mostly in all age groups, although infants or the elderly might have a less frequent or different presentation of symptoms.21 epidemiology and historical outbreaks mpox virus was identified first in monkeys in 1958 during the occurrence of outbreaks in colonies of captive monkeys that were kept for purposes of research in a danish research institute, and has since evolved into a zoonotic infection affecting the human population.37,38,39,40 the first detection of mpox in a human host was discovered on 01 september 1970 in a baby in the democratic republic of the congo.38,39,40,41,42 since the campaign for worldwide smallpox vaccination gradually ended between the 1970s and 1980s, and smallpox was eventually eradicated by 1977, the number of human mpox cases in africa has been on the increase.43,44,45,46 the who verified a case of mpox later in 1980, and since then the virus has spread globally with a ten-fold increase in the past decades.38,39 in 1982, active mpox surveillance programmes were started in the democratic republic of the congo. this increased the number of detected cases. a high number of approximately 386 cases was observed in the democratic republic of the congo alone, whereas only 18 cases were observed in other endemic countries, with children being most affected.47,48 in 1986, mpox surveillance programmes in the democratic republic of the congo were terminated because of the onset of another epidemic, termed aids, in africa. this prompted the who to redirect its resources on public health.49,50 there was a decline in the number of confirmed human mpox cases in the decade that followed. no case was reported to the who beyond 1992. it was only in 1996 and 1997 that a cluster of 344 cases were reported in the democratic republic of the congo among a cohort predominantly unvaccinated against smallpox.51 since then, outbreaks have been common in the democratic republic of the congo. annually, over 1000 cases have been reported since 2005.44 in nigeria, there was a complete hiatus of cases for 39 years until 2017, when mpox re-emerged. a sizable country-wide outbreak of over 120 laboratory-confirmed or -suspected infections involving clade ii was then recorded.51 several factors, including population density, shifting patterns of land use, and declining herd immunity provided by smallpox vaccination were reported to be providing opportunities for more zoonotic transmission and outbreaks.51 in contrast, between 1970 and 2018, case reports of human mpox infection from other countries were infrequent.43,44 mpox re-emerged as a global outbreak in may 2022, with almost 86 000 cases and 53 deaths confirmed from 110 countries around the world, especially in areas where the disease had not been common.13 in 2023, there was an occurrence of mpox in the united states3 with 47 human cases that might be a result of close interaction with prairie dogs which were alleged to have been infected during a shipment imported from ghana.1 a recent outbreak was also reported in europe and africa, with suspected cases and total deaths recorded across different countries between 2022 and 2024. the african region experienced a surge in cases in july 2024. these data outline the outbreak trends across various geographical locations from 2022 to 2024.21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42 the geographical location and demographics revealed mpox occurrences mainly in central, east, and west africa, as well as multi-country outbreaks for clade iib, lineage b.1. demographics indicated morbidities of 70% and above, except for adults in burundi, across all clades and sub-clades, with a preponderance in men. sexual intercourse mode of transmission is reported to contribute more to the spread of the virus, especially by men who have sexual intercourse with other men.21 previously, the age of people infected with mpox ranged from 7 months to 40 years,47 where more than 80% of the mpox cases were seen in children under 10 years of age.47 the attributable deaths also occurred in children.47 the median age of the affected people moved from younger children of 4 years old in the 1970s to the median age of young adults of 21 years between 2010 and 2019.3 this could be because of the suspension of smallpox vaccinations which offered some form of herd immunity against mpox.3 however, recently in 2024, the age of people infected with mpox ranged from 0 years to 65 years, and men between 18 years and 44 years old continued to be excessively affected by the outbreak, accounting for 79.2% of reported cases, while women account for 3.6%. moreover, a rash is reported in 88% of cases with at least one reported symptom, and is thus the most common symptom.21 it was reported that the denotation of a symptom may differ throughout reporting systems in different countries as a result of a general lack of negative reporting and symptom classifications.21 management, potential therapeutics, and vaccines the treatment of mpox infections involves community-based and clinical measures to limit its spread.52,53 in community and clinical settings, patients should stay at home, and avoid contact with infected people, and healthcare professionals should follow guidelines to reduce the risk of infection.8,54 the guidelines include avoiding direct contact with skin lacerations, treating skin rashes with personal protective equipment, and wearing gloves.55 infected individuals should be isolated for approximately 2–4 weeks to decrease the spread of the virus and mitigate the impact of possible outbreaks.56 in addition, supportive care is essential for patients with limited antiviral therapies, including hydration, nutrition, symptomatic management, and antibiotic treatment.57,58,59 in immunocompromised patients, superinfection and eye infections can be managed with antibiotics.60 intensive care management and mechanical ventilation are often used for respiratory and neurological issues.61 potential antiviral agents new antiviral agents and vaccines such as cidofovir, brincidofovir, tecovirimat, immunoglobulin acam2000®, and jynneostm offer new therapeutic prospects for orthopoxviruses.62,63 smallpox, mpox, and cowpox share collective genetic similarities, which include shared surface proteins such as antibodies, and t-cell receptors.62 in addition, some smallpox vaccines create antibodies against a range of epitopes that bind to the shared epitopes of mpox proteins.63 the antiviral resistance of cidofovir is slow, affecting poxviruses through serial passage.63,64,65 it is effective in treating compound orthopoxvirus infections and is used in humans for poxvirus infections, molluscum contagiosum, and aids-associated cytomegalovirus retinitis.66,67 brincidofovir, a lipid-conjugated cidofovir analogue, was united states food and drug administration -approved in 2021 for smallpox therapy because of its comprehensive activity against double-stranded dna viruses and lower ec50 compared to cidofovir.68,69 its lipophilicity allows efficient entry into host cells and a prolonged intracellular half-life.69,70 oral brincidofovir has shown potential in treating poxvirus infections and pre-proactive therapy of adenovirus viraemia.71,72,73,74,75 tecovirimat, fda-approved in 2018, targets the v061 gene in cowpox and the membrane protein p37, which is responsible for extracellular enveloped virus formation.76,77 it is available in intravenous and oral forms and has no documented cross-resistance.78,79 it is effective in treating orthopoxviruses in animal models, preventing death, and reducing viral distribution to distant tissues.80 tecovirimat is used to treat orthopoxvirus infections in human patients because of its tolerance levels. four clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate its safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics.81 vaccinia immune globulin intravenous is an fda-approved immunoglobulin used to manage smallpox vaccination and adverse effects in skin disorders.82 it provides passive immunity but is not recommended for immunocompromised patients, diabetic renal complications, or sepsis history.83 clinicians may consider vaccinia immune globulin intravenous for complex mpox infections or t-cell immunodeficiency patients; however, live attenuated vaccines should be avoided 3 months after vaccination.84 vaccines and immunisations first-generation smallpox vaccines were effective, but adverse effects led to subsequent vaccine development.85 currently, three licensed mpox vaccines are available: modified vaccinia ankara-bn, lc16-kmb, and orthopoxvac.86 the fda has authorised acam2000 and jynneos for smallpox prevention and cross-protective immunity.87 the vacv can be treated with vaccinations, either before or after exposure.88 post-exposure prophylaxis should be administered 4 days or less after exposure, to prevent symptomatic infection.89 if mpox symptoms are absent, post-exposure prophylaxis can be administered up to 14 days after exposure. the fda authorised jynneos intradermal injection as a route of administration for emergency use in august 2022, in addition to the previously approved subcutaneous injection.90,91 the jynneos vaccine, approved by the fda for alternative use in mpox virus-infected persons, works by eliciting humoral and cellular immune responses.92 preclinical research indicates that mpox vaccination is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, although there is no preclinical research available for paediatric patients, despite being safe in immunocompromised people such as hiv patients.93 the acam2000 is a licensed vaccine for smallpox and mumps, given in single doses and lyophilised for long-term storage.93,94 it aims to balance the risk of pathogenic mpox with potential side effects from replicative vaccinations. furthermore, acam2000 is not recommended for hiv-positive patients since they have immunosuppressed systems, as it is a live vaccine that can cause severe complications. attenuated vacv, also known as modified vaccinia ankara, requires two injection treatments. live vacv immunisation has been linked to skin infections, premature delivery, congenital abnormalities, stillbirth, and perinatal mortality.94 however, vacv immunisation has a safer profile and fewer side effects compared to acam2000.95,96 healthcare professionals and laboratory people who are at a high risk of exposure are also evaluated for pre-exposure prophylaxis.84 world health organization guidelines on therapeutic interventions and vaccines for mpox pre-exposure immunisation for high-risk persons and post-exposure vaccination within 4–14 days is suggested by the who’s normative recommendations for mpox, to avoid or minimise the seriousness of the disease.21,90 vaccination should be used in combination with public health interventions such as contact tracing, isolation, and surveillance.10,21 target product profiles, which outline required vaccination qualities, have also been produced by the who.21,94,95 clinical administration places significance on supportive care related to medicine, and antivirals according to who guidelines.21,54,62,63 to ensure the reasonable allocation of vaccinations, treatments, and diagnostics, the who has also set up access and distribution processes, and has modified its recommendations in response to new information.21,50 laboratory diagnosis of mpox a critical factor in the diagnosis of infections, including the mpox virus, rests on laboratory diagnosis.96,97,98,99 two of the definitive methods for the laboratory diagnosis of mpox infection are the direct and indirect methods. for the indirect method, specimens collected are screened for the virus, the nucleic acid, or the viral antigens. to identify the dna, nucleic acid amplification testing is employed for the direct method. on the other hand, immune responses to the viral antigens form the basis for the detection using the indirect method.98 specimen collection, transport, and storage the main sample for laboratory diagnosis of mpox infection is the skin lesions, such as swabs from lesion exudate or lesion crusts. ideally, lesions, crusts, and vesicular fluids should not be placed in a similar tube, to obtain good dna or prevent inhibitors.97,98,99 oropharyngeal swabs, rectal or genital swabs, semen, or urine may be collected based on clinical manifestations.98,99 blood samples are also used, especially when treated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. this process may increase the concentration of the virus; however, it may not align with samples collected from lesions, as viraemia typically occurs during the early stages of infection or the prodromal phase. sample collection should be done by trained healthcare personnel in an appropriate clinical or field setting, using personal protective equipment, and then transported to laboratories with the appropriate level of biosafety for analysis.35,100 after collection of samples for laboratory diagnosis of mpox, samples should be placed in the fridge at 2 °c – 8 °c or kept chilled at –2 °c within an hour after collection, before transportation to the base laboratory. emphasis is usually placed on the storage and handling of specimens while being transported. if it is anticipated that it may exceed 7 days before processing of specimens following transportation, such samples must be stored at –20 °c or a lower temperature, or at –70 °c if storage will exceed 60 days after collection, to obviate false negative results caused by, for example, inability to extract dna.98,99 virus isolation the first isolate of the mpox virus was obtained in 1958 from cynomolgus monkeys using monkey kidney and human amnion cells.101 in humans, the virus was first isolated from a patient with a skin infection resembling smallpox. this was achieved by infecting pig embryo kidney cells, homo sapiens epithelial carcinoma cells, and african green monkey kidney cells, where cytopathic effects were observed.102 although research laboratories have employed culture-based techniques for the identification of the mpox virus, the routine identification of the virus is not recommended by the who as it is not only laborious, but has low sensitivity and takes some days, and must be performed using a biosafety level-3 safety chamber.97,98 electron microscopy the use of electron microscopy is a known method for identifying structures, including the fine details of the virus after isolation. this method reveals that the mpox virus has a brick-shaped or ovoid format, displaying intricate internal structures such as a double-stranded dna genome and enzymes. although electron microscopy is useful in revealing progeny virions in different phases of assembly, immature and mature ones, in infected cells, it is not recommended for routine laboratory diagnosis of the mpox virus.102,103,104 serological methods the use of serology to ascertain immune responses, immunoglobulin m and immunoglobulin g antibodies to mpox infection by use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, plaque reduction neutralisation test, complement fixation test, haemagglutination inhibition, and immunofluorescence are all of diagnostic value. however, results obtained should be interpreted with caution because of cross reactions or shared antigenic determinants among the orthopoxviruses or, in recent cases of vaccination, against smallpox.105,106 clinical laboratory findings and biomarkers to complement laboratory methods, variations of biochemical and haematological indices, such as thrombocytopenia, rated as the most common, hypoalbuminaemia, leucocytosis, and increased transaminase level are critical.1 other findings indicate that higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase may be related to poor prognosis. in addition, cytokine modulation has been reported to correlate with the severity of mpox in humans.107,108 the cytokines comprise interleukins 1b, 2r, 4-8, and 13, among others.98,108 the polymerase chain reaction test on lesions was, however, reported to give the highest clinical sensitivity, 91% – 100%,109,110,111,112 whereas the sensitivity of saliva, nasopharyngeal swab, and oral swabs was between 68% and 100%, seminal fluid was 78% – 100%,109,111 and rectal swabs were 78% – 97%.112 genome sequencing for epidemiological purposes or monitoring of transmission patterns as an adjunct to conventional laboratory analysis of mpox infection, whole genome dna sequencing is critical for observing differences in the viral genome over time. genome sequencing is not recommended for routine diagnosis due to its expensive outlay, high cost of reagents, and the advanced training required for the process. few samples of patients may require genome sequencing from samples as genome monitoring of circulating types may assist policymakers and healthcare personnel in terms of decision-making as well as the introduction of measures to reduce or abrogate the chain of transmission.99,113,114 real-time polymerase chain reaction it has been reported that real-time pcr is the gold standard molecular method for lab-based diagnosis of mpox.35,97,98 the real-time pcr workflow for mpox detection involves several key steps: denaturation, annealing, extension, and fluorescence readout. initially, the double-stranded dna is denatured to separate the strands into single strands, which facilitates the binding of primers to their respective target regions. the forward and reverse primers are designed to bind to specific sites on the single-stranded dna. the reverse primer plays a critical role in this process by binding to the complementary strand, enabling the synthesis of the complementary strand during the extension phase. during annealing, both the forward and reverse primers bind to their target sequences on the dna. following this, dna polymerase synthesises the complementary strand in the extension phase. the fluorescence signal is then released, allowing for real-time detection of the target sequence. regarding other tests involved, this real-time pcr assay specifically measures the amplification of target dna sequences, such as those within the g2r, b7r, b6r, n3r, and tnf receptor genes in the mpox virus genome, as previously reported.113,115 additionally, multiplex real-time pcr assays can be used to detect and differentiate various infectious agents and different subclades of the mpox virus.113,114,115,116,117,118,119 loop-mediated isothermal amplification real-time pcr is a standard technique method for diagnosing mpox infection; however, its shortcomings comprise sample processing time, constant availability of electricity supply, and technical skills.113,120 consequently, in terms of point of care, a user-friendly, simple, inexpensive, and rapid method for the laboratory diagnosis of mpox in low- to middle-income countries or areas with simple laboratory infrastructure are warranted. loop-mediated isothermal amplification is a recommended technique for the amplification of nucleic acid at a single and isothermal temperature of about 60 °c – 65 °c. while lamp requires less equipment than real-time pcr, it still relies on electricity, which may limit its utility in areas with inconsistent power supply. nevertheless, its simplicity and low-cost nature make it a valuable option for resource-limited settings.121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128 recombinase-based isothermal amplification assays recombinase-based isothermal amplification assays are also isothermal amplification methods involving enzyme-based dna amplification at a constant temperature of around 37 °c to 42 °c within 10 min,127 and, because of its simplicity, high sensitivity, and rapidity, this method is suitable for point-of-care or field applicability for mpox detection. sensors sensors are also used in laboratory diagnosis based on their ability to respond to stimuli, biological, physical, and chemical agents that elicit observable effects that are measurable through electrochemistry, colourimetry, and fluorescence. their applications are simple, rapid, inexpensive, and adaptable for use in rural or less-resourced settings.129 in terms of the method, the rna sensors or toehold switches can stimulate the translation of a reporter gene, such as beta-galactosidase or a green fluorescent protein, against a receptor rna trigger sequence present in the sample. this results in the activation of a reporter protein, followed by a light reflection that generates an observable colour change. alternatively, fluorescence-based methods may use fluorescent dyes such as 6-carboxyfluorescein or sybr green to detect the presence of the target rna, generating a measurable fluorescence signal.129,130,131 prevention and control for effective control of mpox outbreaks, rapid recognition and investigation of new cases, along with a comprehensive understanding of all possible routes and modes of transmission, are essential strategies for vaccine distribution.7 prevention of transmission of the mpox virus principally depends on hygienic practices and restrictions on contact with wild animals as the primary transmission mode of the virus to humans.1,84 direct contact with an infected animal should be prevented to avoid the animal-to-human route. additionally, physical contact with other people who are infected should be avoided, personal protective equipment should be used to reduce transmission, and there should be isolation of patients with mild cases of the disease.9 in cases where a person presents with lesions caused by mpox around the genitals, sexual contact must be avoided, or condoms should be used to avoid transmission.13 although the majority of mpox cases during the 2022 outbreak occurred in men who have sex with men, the infection can affect individuals of all genders and age groups. during pregnancy, special precautions are necessary to prevent vertical transmission from mother to child through the placenta. additionally, perinatal transmission can be avoided by preventing neonatal contact with mpox-related genital lesions during childbirth.131,132,133,134 other avenues of transmission include tourism and travelling.132 hence, prevention and control of the mpox virus can also be affected by controlling international air travel volume and entrenching policies regarding entry into countries. deng et al.40 showed that a reduction in the volume of air travel and strict policies on border entry contributed to a reduction of mpox introductions of infected persons into china.13 smallpox vaccine has been shown to provide almost 85% protection against mpox because of herd immunity.11 pre- and post-prophylaxis vaccination has also been recommended by the healthcare authorities for healthcare workers, laboratory workers and technicians, response teams against outbreaks, as well as scientists who research clinical samples, and vaccinators.84 post-exposure prophylaxis is suggested when there has been unprotected contact with infected people or there has been sharing of close spaces with infected people for extended periods where there might be secretions of aerosols and the presence of the virus in the air particles.84 vaccines, antiviral agents, and drugs such as tecovirimat are used as the first line of treatment. challenges and future perspectives mpox prevention, treatment, and control face several challenges, including healthcare gaps and the limited availability of treatments, vaccinations, and resource environments.135,136 diagnostic challenges, such as access to advanced technologies, can hinder timely and accurate diagnosis.137 additionally, fever-like illnesses accompanied by a rash may be misdiagnosed as mpox.49 to effectively control mpox, strong public health systems are required to monitor and manage outbreaks, and trace contacts. however, underdeveloped systems in endemic areas make containment difficult.138 public mistrust of vaccines, especially in poorly literate areas, can impede mass vaccination campaigns. immunisation resistance, motivated by misleading information, remains a significant barrier.139 recommendations the following recommendations are of significance in the narratives concerning mpox: • global emergency preparedness to tackle the potential pandemic of the disease is critical and should be actioned. • training and re-training of healthcare professionals on the differential diagnosis and other intricate aspects of the disease. • enhanced research activities to uncover emerging clades and their genomes, more insights into their epidemiology, and genomic surveillance to identify changes and adjust vaccines should be prioritised. • increased provision of vaccines, especially to endemic areas to curb centrifugal spread, should be central to the strategies to tackle the disease. • increased allocation of resources by countries in a bid to contain the menace of the disease and its anticipated health burden. • development of simple screening and diagnostic test kits or methods especially for use in less-resourced countries. conclusion mpox is not a new disease, but an emerging and re-emerging disease caused, probably, by increased rates of zoonoses, deforestation, food insecurity, global mobility, and increased socialisation pressures. others include risky behaviours and decreased immunity to the smallpox virus, which shares cross-reactive antigenic determinants with the mpox virus, resulting in waning protection offered by herd immunity against mpox. the key drivers of infections across various age groups and countries over the past years were the various clades. the historical foci of the disease have been mainly in africa, in addition to reported cases in other continents, indicating varying degrees of morbidity and mortality in all affected countries. management of the disease may depend on the range of clinical manifestations, including the use of antivirals, and antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections. preventive and control measures are predicated on the isolation of patients, protective sexual intercourse, avoiding contact with fluids of infected persons, and vaccination, among others. laboratory diagnosis involves the use of pcr for routine purposes, but the use of serological tests should be interpreted with caution because of shared antigenicity among the orthopoxvirues. electron microscopy and genome sequencing are mainly for research-related endeavours.
mpox 2022 to 2025 update: a comprehensive review on its complications, transmission, diagnosis, and treatment abstract monkeypox virus is a zoonotic orthopoxvirus that has gained increased global attention due to recent outbreaks. the current review reports the latest update of mpox cases from 25 february 2022 to 29 april 2025. it also evaluates the possible major complications in human life caused by mpox. in early 2022, more than 40 countries reported mpox outbreaks. as of 12 june 2024, the global case count for the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak was 97,281 confirmed cases, in 118 countries. the world health organization declared the mpox virus, a zoonotic disease, a public health emergency of international concern on 14 august 2024. mpox symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, and face-to-body rashes. the review also highlights mpox virus replication, genomics, pathology, transmission, diagnosis, and antiviral therapies. the 2022 outbreak is also discussed in detail. the coinfection of hiv in patients infected with mpox is also discussed. the evolving mpox epidemiology has raised concerns about the disease’s increasing spread in non-endemic countries, emphasizing the urgent need for control and prevention. the discussion on preventive measures, including vaccination, suggests that cross-protection against mpox may be possible using orthopoxvirus-specific antibodies. although there are no specific antiviral drugs available, certain drugs, such as tecovirimat, cidofovir, and ribavirin, are worth considering. 1. introduction monkeypox is a viral disease caused by the mpox virus. according to the latest report of the world health organization globally, 137,892 confirmed cases of mpox have been reported from 1 january 2022 to 31 march 2025. out of these, 317 deaths were confirmed across 132 countries. mpox virus is an enveloped double-stranded dna with around 200 kb of nucleotides, which is brick-shaped and has a tubule-like structure on its surface. additionally, it has a dumbbell-shaped core structure that measures up to 200 to 250 nm. this virus belongs to the genus orthopoxvirus and the family of poxviridae. mpox resembles smallpox, and the disease is spread via zoonosis. there are two clades of mpox: clade i and clade ii. both have a sequence similarity of about 95%. the fatality rate of clade i is three times higher than that of clade ii. mpox has a linear dna genome that contains around 190 non-overlapping open reading frames. mpox genomes contain a highly conserved central region, while the terminal region is highly variable, having inverted terminal repeats. all mpox viruses have four orfs in the itr region. the gene loss at the terminal region acts as a driving force for the evolution of the new mpox. the ultrastructural analysis study in 2022 revealed that virus replication occurs in the mini-nucleus, which is reorganized by endoplasmic reticulum cisternae in the host cell. the early mrna and late mrna form in the mini nucleus, which consecutively form the early protein and the late protein. as a result, an intracellular mature virus is released in the cytoplasm and comes outside of the cell by exocytosis to form an enveloped extracellular virus or extracellular mature virus, which is ready to infect another host cell. mpox is not considered a sexually transmitted disease, although the mpox virus dna was detected in semen and seminal fluid samples in italy and germany in the 2022 global outbreak. despite various studies on the mpox virus, the anal or vaginal route can be considered a mucosal membrane route. virus mutation and the re-emergence of pathogens with unusual transmission routes may enhance infection and increase the possibility of an epidemic. since 2022, two major mpox outbreaks have prompted the world health organization to declare public health emergencies of international concern, first in july 2022 and again in august 2024. the initial global spread, attributed to a clade 2b strain, resulted in roughly 100,000 cases and 200 fatalities. subsequently, a new clade, 1b, emerged, leading to a second surge. as of december 2024, this recent outbreak has seen over 55,000 reported or suspected cases and approximately 1000 deaths, primarily in the democratic republic of congo and neighboring nations such as burundi, rwanda, uganda, and angola. isolated cases of clade 1b have also been documented in countries including the uk, sweden, germany, belgium, france, the usa, canada, and thailand. the details of the outbreaks of 2024 and 2022 are as follows. 1.1. the 2024 outbreak the mpox clade 1b variant, initially detected in the sud kivu area of the democratic republic of congo, has emerged as a major public health threat due to its increased ability to spread between people. genetic investigation of clade 1b has uncovered numerous mutations of mpox. the genetic makeup of clade 1b shows several mutations in genes related to the enzyme apolipoprotein b mrna editing catalytic polypeptide-like 3 cytosine deaminase. this enzyme’s involvement is often indicative of sustained human-to-human transmission. these genetic alterations distinguish clade 1b from the traditionally circulating clade i variant, enabling more efficient spread through close physical contact, including sexual contact. genetic changes, particularly those linked to apobec3, are thought to contribute to clade 1b’s enhanced transmissibility. since its initial identification, this variant has expanded its reach within the drc to other provinces and has also been reported in neighboring nations like rwanda, uganda, and kenya, signifying a considerable geographical expansion of the outbreak. the democratic republic of congo was the epicenter and reported 3235 mpox infections and 19 deaths as of 11 august 2024. the emergence of the clade 1b mpox in neighboring central and east african countries has raised significant concerns about the potential for a wider regional epidemic. burundi had recorded 545 mpox alerts by 17 august 2024, and 142 were confirmed positive for the clade ib mpox variant. rwanda confirmed its initial two mpox infections on 24 july 2024, prompting the ministry of health to declare an outbreak on july 27. by 7 august 2024, rwanda had reported a total of four confirmed cases of the clade 1b variant of mpox, with no associated deaths. in uganda, initially, six suspected cases were identified in june 2024, and out of those six, two were confirmed later. as of 13 august 2024, kenya has identified 14 suspected cases, with one confirmed positive for clade ib mpox. to date, no deaths have been reported. in august 2024, the clade 1b strain’s spread beyond africa was confirmed for the first time. the virus has also extended its reach to countries in east africa, europe, and asia, underscoring its capacity for worldwide spread. sweden reported a case involving a traveler returning from an affected region, demonstrating the pivotal role of international travel in spreading infectious diseases globally. this event prompted urgent calls for governments to enhance border checks, implement targeted surveillance, and foster international collaboration to control cross-border disease transmission. on 22 august 2024, thailand reported its initial mpox case of a european man with a recent travel history to africa. likewise, india’s identification of its first imported clade 1b mpox case in kerala highlights the potential for international travel to contribute to the dissemination of this variant. from november 2024 to 12 february 2025, four cases of clade ib were detected. in the united states, the first confirmed case of clade ib mpox occurred in california in november 2024, following travel to an affected region. a second case was identified in georgia on 14 january 2025, involving a traveler from a country with ongoing mpox transmission. subsequent cases were reported in new hampshire on 7 february 2025 and in new york on 12 february 2025. these four cases represent independent events, with no epidemiological links established and no evidence of further transmission. the 2024 outbreak emphasized the importance of aligning travel health policies with robust outbreak management strategies to minimize risks from rapidly spreading pathogens. a significant public health crisis unfolded between 2022 and 31 december 2024, with global records documenting over 118,777 mpox infections. between 2022 and 2024, the different regions of the americas documented 67,220 confirmed mpox cases, resulting in 151 deaths across 31 countries and territories. the majority of these cases occurred in 2022, followed by a substantial decline in 2023. a minor increase was observed in 2024, with 5548 cases. the world health organization has determined that the highly contagious clade 1b strain is the primary driver of this outbreak, characterized by severe symptoms and increased mortality. the most affected areas that reported a large number of infections were east, central, west, and southern africa, specifically, burundi, kenya, rwanda, uganda, the central african republic, ivory coast, and south africa. the swift dissemination of the virus in these areas underscores the critical need for collaborative containment efforts and enhanced healthcare systems to effectively address such epidemics. 1.2. the 2022 outbreak before 2022, mpox cases were documented within the african continent. the first case of the 2022 outbreak of the mpox outside the african continent was recorded on 6 may 2022 in the united kingdom. a total of 366 mpox cases were confirmed in the united kingdom until 10 june 2022. on 18 may 2022, portugal reported 14 mpox infections, spain reported seven, and canada reported 13. the first mpox cases in belgium, sweden, and italy were confirmed on 19 may 2022. france, germany, australia, and the netherlands each reported their initial mpox cases on 20 may 2022. switzerland and israel each confirmed their initial mpox cases on may 21. by 24 may 2022, 19 countries had reported cases of mpox. among these, the united arab emirates identified its first case in late may, involving a 29-year-old female traveler from west africa. slovenia also confirmed its initial infection. denmark’s first case was linked to an individual returning from the canary islands. in canada, quebec reported fifteen confirmed cases on 24 may, the same day the czech republic confirmed its first case. the study published in the new england journal on 21 july 2022 reported a total of 528 mpox infections between 27 april and 24 june 2022, at 43 sites within 16 countries. by 27 may 2022, portugal had confirmed 96 mpox cases, and the information regarding demographics, clinical presentation, and exposure was collected from all 96 cases via face-to-face and telephone interviews using standardized case investigation forms. a subset of 27 confirmed cases underwent more detailed investigation, and their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, along with available laboratory and epidemiological findings, are summarized in a previous study published in eurosurveillance in june 2022. the majority of cases of the 2022 portugal outbreak resided in the lisbon and tagus valley region, with single cases in the north and algarve regions. all cases were male, ages ranging from 22 to 51 years. considering exposures within the 21 days preceding symptom onset, few reported contact with individuals exhibiting similar symptoms, and some had a history of international travel. most cases were identified as men who have sex with men, while one reported sex with only women. during the 21 days before symptom onset, most cases with available data reported multiple sexual partners. six cases reported attending a sauna in the lvt region, one frequented a uk sauna, and four reported international travel—three reported contacts with animals. common symptoms included exanthema, inguinal lymphadenopathy, fever, and genital ulcers. fourteen cases were hiv-positive. three cases required hospitalization, two of whom were later discharged. no deaths were reported by 27 may 2022. one middle-aged case reported prior smallpox vaccination. in may 2022, the world health organization declared a global health emergency for a previous mpox outbreak caused by clade iib of the virus. almost 48 cases of mpox were reported from different regions of latin america, such as brazil, argentina, peru, venezuela, mexico, colombia, and chile, by 28 june 2022. in july 2022, the multi-country mpox outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern due to its rapid spread through sexual contact in regions previously unaffected by the virus. this declaration was lifted in may 2023 following a sustained global decline in cases. the outbreak had infected 87,000 people and resulted in 140 deaths. the who attributed the successful containment to a combination of vaccination and public health information campaigns. most of these countries have set up their epidemiological centers for the identification of these viruses. according to the centers for disease control and prevention, as of 7 february 2024, the maximum number of reported cases in the usa is 31,894, followed by brazil, spain, and france. the geographical distribution of the mpox in countries affected in africa is illustrated in figure 2a, while the recent trends of mpox cases in africa are shown in figure 2b. 2. host reservoirs and transmission mpox is a zoonotic disease; central african rodents and primates are the natural hosts of mpox. the mpox virus is primarily transmitted from animals to humans through close contact, such as bites, scratches, or exposure to the animal’s rash, as well as through exposure to their bodily fluids or consumption of improperly cooked meat. transmission can also occur via contaminated materials like bedding or clothing. historically, human-to-human transmission has been less frequent. a 2018 case study reported that a man traveling from nigeria to the uk on september 6th presented with a maculopapular rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy and was subsequently diagnosed with mpox. one of the three attending healthcare workers developed symptoms, was isolated, and had 134 contacts traced and monitored. four of these contacts later became ill. this incident demonstrates human-to-human transmission of mpox from a traveler returning from nigeria to healthcare staff. historically, mpox infection was primarily linked to animal contact or travel to endemic regions. however, the transmission pattern shifted in the 2022 outbreak, with most cases now attributed to sexual contact. over the last two years, predominantly gay and bisexual men have been affected. the study reveals that the risk of public transmission was very low because mpox virus transmission from human to human requires close contact. human-to-human transmission of the mpox virus occurred through direct contact through blood transfusion, respiratory droplet infection, sharing of foods, clothes, and bedding, and sexual activity, especially with male-to-male sex. the mpox virus may be transmitted from the mother to the fetus during pregnancy, and that type of transmission is called vertical transmission. the different proposed model admits that during the entry of the mpox virus through the respiratory epithelium in humans, the mpox virus enters dendritic cells and macrophages, which then enter lymphatic vessels and the lymphatic system. in the same way, when the mpox virus infects the skin epidermis, it first infects fibroblast cells and langerhans cells, which move in lymphatic vessels and then into the lymphatic system. in this way, it spreads all over the body and infects the liver, which may cause serious liver problems. 3. complications associated with mpox the various complications that have been observed in mpox-infected persons are the following. 3.1. neurological and psychiatric complications mpox infections are associated with potential neurological and mental health complications. research conducted in nigeria in 2020 indicated that a quarter of hospitalized mpox patients experienced psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. however, it is difficult to isolate these symptoms from the psychological impact of hospitalization and isolation. neurological issues, including seizures, confusion, and encephalitis, were observed in mpox patients during the 2022 outbreak, with reported occurrences of 2.7%, 2.4%, and 2%, respectively. furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed the presence of mpox-specific igm antibodies. studies indicate that neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in 50% of individuals with mpox infection. badenoch and colleagues suggest that symptoms occur in more than half of cases. these symptoms may arise from the infection itself or the experience of quarantine. additionally, research conducted in iraq has revealed widespread anxiety among the general population concerning the ongoing mpox outbreak. this research sought to evaluate public awareness, perceptions, and anxiety related to the multi-country mpox outbreak within the kurdistan region of iraq. a digital survey utilizing a convenience sampling approach was conducted from 27 to 30 july 2022. the study included 510 participants. overall, the population demonstrated a moderate understanding of mpox, held a neutral attitude toward it, and experienced a moderate level of anxiety. statistical analysis revealed that demographic factors, including gender, religion, education level, and place of residence, significantly impacted awareness and anxiety levels. gender and the residential area also played a significant role in shaping attitudes toward mpox. 3.2. dermatological complications a common characteristic of mpox infection is the appearance of skin lesions, particularly in the anogenital region. skin lesions present as a rash that progresses through distinct stages: initially flat, then raised, and subsequently fluid-filled. these lesions typically resolve with crusting within three weeks. a characteristic mpox rash begins with small, flat or raised lesions, typically 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter. these lesions progress over two to three weeks, evolving into fluid-filled vesicles and pus-filled pustules, often with a central depression, and eventually form crusts. the vesicles and pustules themselves are generally spherical, ranging from 0.5 to 2 cm in diameter, and are notable for their firm texture, deep skin involvement, and well-defined edges. a hallmark of mpox is a unique rash characterized by painful or itchy maculopapular lesions that progress into a vesiculopustular eruption. typically, the rash emerges within one to three days following the onset of initial symptoms. however, variations exist, with some individuals experiencing the rash more than three days after fever onset or concurrently with the fever. lesions commonly manifest on the face, trunk, extremities, genital region, scalp, palms, and soles. the rash often begins on the face and then spreads outward to the limbs, palms, soles, and mucous membranes of the mouth, eyes, and genitals. a higher concentration of lesions is generally observed on the face and limbs. in some cases, oral lesions, known as enanthems, may precede the appearance of the skin rash. a comprehensive review of available research indicates that sore throat is the most frequently reported oral symptom of mpox, while ulceration is the most common oral or peri-oral sign. in one study of 54 patients, all presented with skin lesions, with a significant majority exhibiting anogenital involvement. a large portion of these patients reported lesions at multiple anatomical sites, and a smaller percentage had lesions in the oropharyngeal area. additionally, a substantial number of patients experienced fatigue and fever, while a minority showed no initial symptoms. in some cases, genital ulcers were observed to be painless, accompanied by bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy, resembling the presentation of primary syphilis. a separate international study, tracking 528 mpox infections in 2022, also identified anogenital lesions as a prevalent symptom. this study found that 73% of patients had anogenital lesions, and 41% presented with mucosal lesions. a rash was observed in 95% of patients, with other frequently reported symptoms including fever, lymphadenopathy, lethargy, muscle aches, and headaches. due to the varied and evolving clinical presentation of mpox, especially as seen in the 2022 outbreak, medical professionals, particularly dermatologists, are advised to exercise a high degree of vigilance when evaluating patients with suspected mpox infection. the other study, conducted in 101 patients from thirteen countries, shows that 54% of cases have been found with skin lesions. during the initial five days of infection, papules, vesicles, and pustules were the most frequently observed skin lesions. from days 6–10, pustules became the dominant lesion, followed by erosions/ulcers and crusts/scabs. after day 11, crusts/scabs were the primary skin manifestation. while monkeypox treatment remains largely symptomatic due to the lack of specific antiviral medications, a novel therapeutic approach combining antimicrobial photodynamic therapy and photobiomodulation therapy successfully treated a large facial cutaneous lesion, highlighting its potential as a promising intervention. 3.3. complications related to the coinfection of mpox virus and hiv the covid-19 pandemic, which began in 2020, demonstrated the rapid emergence of viral diseases and the potential for global spread, highlighting the ongoing threat of mpox. mpox may be more lethal for immunocompromised people, such as those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. the coinfection of mpox virus and hiv was first identified and diagnosed in latin america. in 2022, the recent coinfection of mpox and acute hiv was also confirmed in a 24-year-old male with outstretched papules throughout the trunk, face, and genital area. a 2023 review in vaccine reported 6345 confirmed mpox cases across 53 studies, with a 40.32% hiv co-infection rate. according to who, 51% of confirmed cases of mpox have hiv. the outbreak of mpox in multiple countries was reported during 2022–24. according to the who report, the maximum number of confirmed cases came from the european region, followed by america, the african region, and the eastern mediterranean region. co-infection with hiv increases the chance of infection in an uninfected person by enhancing the concentration of hiv on genital organs and genital secretions or by increasing both factors. individuals living with hiv, especially those with compromised immune systems characterized by low cd4 cell counts, demonstrate an increased vulnerability to severe mpox complications and mortality compared to those without hiv. the immunodeficiency resulting from advanced hiv infection elevates the susceptibility to severe mpox manifestations, which can include necrotizing skin lesions, pulmonary involvement, secondary infections, and sepsis. this study analysed 382 mpox cases, comprising 367 cisgender males, four cisgender females, and ten transgender females. the median age of the participants was 35 years, with an interquartile range of 30 to 43 years. at the time of mpox diagnosis, 349 individuals were known to be living with hiv. among those with hiv, 228 were adhering to antiretroviral therapy. concurrent opportunistic infections were observed in 32 participants. the median cd4 cell count was 211 cells/mm3. specifically, 85 individuals had cd4 counts below 100 cells/mm3, and 94 individuals had counts between 100 and 200 cells/mm3. an undetectable viral load was present in 193 participants. severe mpox complications were significantly more prevalent in individuals with cd4 counts below 100 cells/mm3 compared to those with counts exceeding 300 cells/mm3. these complications included the following: necrotizing skin lesions, pulmonary involvement, sometimes with nodules, and secondary infections and sepsis. hospitalization was required for 107 participants, with 27 of those hospitalized resulting in death. all fatalities occurred in individuals with cd4 counts below 200 cells/mm3. within this group, mortality was higher among those with elevated hiv viral loads. immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome related to mpox was suspected in 21 of the 85 individuals who initiated or restarted art, with 12 of these cases resulting in death. tecovirimat was administered to 62 participants, while cidofovir or brincidofovir was used in seven participants. tecovirimat resistance was confirmed in three cases. 3.4. complications associated with heart myocarditis, pericarditis, and myopericarditis have been rarely documented in mpox infection. two immunocompetent, unvaccinated adults in the u.s. developed monkeypox-related myocarditis. they were hospitalized and presented with cardiac symptoms and elevated biomarkers. oral tecovirimat and doxycycline were provided for the treatment of monkeypox, and they were discharged home after recovery without immediate complications. they received no specific treatment for myocarditis, given the rapid resolution of symptoms and normalization of troponin levels. in a 2022 study, thornhill et al. documented two instances of self-limiting myocarditis associated with monkeypox, where patients recovered within seven days without significant complications. one of these patients had a history of hiv with a normal cd4 count. a wide range of viruses are known to cause myocarditis, such as coxsackieviruses and adenoviruses. viral myocarditis can cause dilated cardiomyopathy. the most frequently observed pathological process involves lymphocytic myocarditis with myocyte necrosis, typically developing 10 to 14 days after the viral infection. the occurrence of myocardial involvement in orthopoxvirus infections was initially documented following smallpox vaccination in young military recruits, using live vaccinia-based vaccines. the precise pathophysiological pathways leading to orthopox-induced myocarditis remain to be determined. heart failure, arrhythmias, and other cardiovascular-related problems may also be possible in mpox infection. 3.5. hypotension sepsis complication in severe cases, significant fluid loss due to fever, rash, and capillary permeability can occur. the associated systemic inflammatory response may also contribute to hypotension. these factors combine to reduce renal perfusion, potentially leading to acute kidney injury. vigilant monitoring of urine output and blood chemistry is essential for early detection and to guide the necessity of intravenous fluid replacement. while infrequent, secondary bacterial infections leading to sepsis have been documented in mpox-infected patients with streptococcus pyogenes. prompt identification of sepsis, utilizing standard diagnostic criteria, is essential. treatment should adhere to established sepsis management protocols, including initiating broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics within one hour of diagnosis, rapid intravenous fluid resuscitation with ongoing response evaluation, vasoactive medication administration, and appropriate respiratory support. 3.6. ocular complication ocular symptoms are uncommon but can cause corneal scarring and vision loss. manifestations, potentially from self-inoculation, include conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and other ocular inflammations. the 2022 mpox outbreak showed a significantly lower ocular involvement rate of approximately 1%, compared to 9–23% in prior outbreaks. mpox can present with a variety of ocular symptoms, including redness, frontal headaches, rashes around the eyes, tearing, discharge, and subconjunctival nodules. less commonly, it may lead to more severe complications like keratitis, corneal ulcers, opacification, perforation, and vision loss. in the 2022 outbreak, these ocular symptoms have been observed less often and potentially with reduced severity. though potential underreporting exists, observational studies suggest an ocular involvement rate of approximately 1%, significantly lower than the 9–23% incidence reported in previous outbreaks in endemic regions. newborns have been reported to experience ocular involvement with mpox. additionally, there are documented cases where ocular symptoms presented independently, without concurrent skin lesions. patients presenting with ocular mpox symptoms should be referred for ophthalmologic evaluation. a slit-lamp examination and dilated fundoscopy are valuable tools for assessing the involvement of both anterior and posterior eye structures. retinol supplementation is advised. supportive measures such as eye lubrication and saline compresses may provide relief. in cases of co-infection, ophthalmic antibiotics or antivirals may be necessary. patients should be instructed to avoid contact lens use. topical trifluridine, under ophthalmological guidance, can be considered for conjunctivitis and is recommended for keratitis management. 3.7. fulminant mpox a severe, widespread, and destructive form of mpox has been observed in individuals with advanced immunosuppression, such as those with cd4 counts below 100 cells/µl, high hiv viral loads, or hepatitis b co-infection. these cases show a resemblance to an aids-defining illness. patients showed extensive, large necrotic skin and mucosal lesions that often merged. severe secondary bacterial infections were frequent. complications included lung nodules, necrotic pulmonary masses, nodular hepatic lesions, respiratory insufficiency, and sepsis. immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome was suspected in a quarter of patients initiating or resuming antiretroviral therapy post-diagnosis. mortality was reported in 15% of patients, primarily those with cd4 counts below 200 cells/µl. in moderately to severely immunocompromised patients with uncontrolled viral dissemination, optimal immune function should be prioritized. tecovirimat should be initiated promptly, and consider adding cidofovir or brincidofovir and vaccinia immune globulin. prolonged treatment may be necessary. wound care is essential, and fluid management may be required. specialist consultation should be considered as needed. close monitoring for complications is vital. 3.8. complications associated with immune system like covid-19 infection, mpox also creates cytokines inside the body. cytokines are th2-mediated, and a large number of interleukins are released, while th1-mediated cytokines are released in a lower amount. therefore, ifγ, il2, il12, tnf-α, and ifn-α levels decreased after mpox infection. the human mpox virus causes post-translational modification on the host cell. it downregulates those regulatory factors that increase histone expression while upregulating core histone proteins. the nucleosome formation of viruses depends on host nucleosome modification. mpox has a specific mechanism through which it defends itself via the immune reaction of the host. the intracellular protein of mpox called viro transducer stops apoptosis in the host cell and stops the host cell from responding against the virus. in this way, these proteins evade the host’s immune system to allow for viral replication in the host, as shown in figure 4. the mpox virus uses various strategies in the host cell to escape from the host immune defense system. innate immunity is the first line of defense and is operated by interferons. interferons prevent viral replication in host cells using direct or indirect pathways. there are three types of interferons: type 1, type 2, and type 3. ifnα, ifnβ, and ifnω are considered type i interferons. type i interferons create antiviral activity in cells by activating janus protein tyrosine kinase and signal transducers and activators of the transcription pathway. mpox virus evades the immune response of the host in the following way: an in vitro study in 2010 showed that mpox viral protein b16 inhibits jak-stat induced by type i interferon. another experiment performed in mice in 2004 found that homologs of d7l block interleukin. the complement control protein of mpox inhibits the complement activation pathway, which is a key factor for viral defense. apart from it, many proteins of mpox are responsible for evasion, including ankyrin-like protein, viral growth factor, il-18 binding protein, apoptosis inhibitors, spi-1, inhibitors of mhc class i molecules, inhibitors of irf3 nf-kb activation, inhibitor of irf3 and irf7 activation, inhibitors of mhc class ii, cc, and cxc chemokine binding proteins. 4. diagnosis of mpox pcr is a gold standard molecular biology technique that detects the presence of mpox viral dna in samples such as blood, skin lesions, or respiratory secretions. pcr is a highly sensitive and specific method used for confirmatory diagnosis. real-time pcr is the most common diagnostic procedure for the detection of mpox. in the 2022–23 outbreak of mpox, four novel molecular kits were used: the novaplex mpxv assay, the standard m10 mpx/opx, the real cycler monk-ux/monk-gx v.2, and the realstar orthopoxvirus pcr kit 1.0, with an in-house pcr assay. a comparison study of diagnostic kits shows that sensitivity and specificity were 100% for the novaplex mpxv assay and realstar orthopoxvirus pcr kit 1.0. the realcycler monk-ux/monk-gx v.2 and standard m10 mpx/opx exhibited a slight decrease in the accuracy and diagnostic sensitivity. the lab diagnosis of viral infections plays a crucial role in the detection of diseases and their treatment. cell culture or tissue culture is considered to be the standard method for the isolation and cultivation of viruses, although this method is considered to be time-consuming and has a high risk of contamination. the other standard methods for the detection of viruses are molecular and non-molecular techniques, electron microscopy-based detection, radiation-based virus detection, nucleic acid amplification methods, antigen-antibody complex-mediated detection of viruses, and crispr-cas system-based detection. urine, saliva, semen, and rectal or genital samples can also be taken for investigative purposes, depending on the clinic. crispr-based detection is also a rising diagnostic method in the field of virology. according to research conducted, a system was designed to detect the mpox viral dna using a fluorescence readout. in this study, it was shown that the g-quadruplex oligonucleotide of the target dna, which was labeled with fluorescein on the 3-prime end and black hole 1-quencher at the 5-prime end, produced a fluorescence signal when it was degraded via the cas-12a-mediated collateral cleavage. this effect was not shown in the absence of the target dna because cas-12a is unable to cleave the labeled g-quadruplex oligonucleotide, and fluorescence quenching happens. pan-orthopoxvirus pcr/esi-ms is another emerging method in the field of diagnostics; it can perform identification of all members of orthomyxovirus without sequencing by using the t5000 platform. here, a pcr method coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was employed to diagnose mpox in spiked human samples and aerosol-infected cynomolgus macaque samples. loop-mediated isothermal amplification is another molecular diagnostic technique used in virology, offering a potential alternative to rt-pcr. this technique uses the displacement of the auto-cycling step of dna synthesis by bst dna polymerase, which replicates the gene without the use of a light cycle. 5. treatment of mpox the treatment of mpox primarily focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. the symptoms, like fever, pain, and itching, can be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. antiviral medication such as tecovirimat has been used for some patients with mpox, particularly those with severe illness or who are at high risk of complications. other antiviral medications, such as brincidofovir and cidofovir, may be considered in certain situations, but their use is generally limited. vaccines are also recommended for people at high risk of exposure. to prevent infection with the mpox virus, avoid close skin contact and contact with contaminated materials. most people with mpox experience mild symptoms and recover without specific treatment. severe cases and complications are more common in individuals with weakened immune systems, children, and pregnant women. 5.1. vaccine strategies against mpox almost a thousand cases have been reported from different parts of the world since april 2022, mostly from non-endemic countries; therefore, it has become necessary to understand the possible risk factors associated with this virus. viral inactivation is a crucial step to prevent the spreading of mpox; among the methods of viral inactivation, heat inactivation is one of the methods of viral inactivation. according to batéjat christophe et al., the mpox virus was inoculated on two growth media named fcs and vtm and then subjected to heat inactivation at different temperatures over a period. this study showed that mpox got inactivated in less than 5 min if heated at 70 °c and less than 15 min if heated at 60 °c, and there was no difference between clade i and clade ii. the united states of america currently has three vaccines against smallpox: jynneostm, also known as imvamune, acam2000®, and aventis pasteur smallpox vaccine. this vaccine jynneostm has been prepared from the modified ortho poxvirus vaccinia ankara-bavarian nordic strain and is attenuated in nature and non-replicating. in august 2007, the fda approved acam2000® for the prevention of smallpox. the acam2000® vaccine is also a live vaccine but shows some differences with jynneos™. acam2000® is a replication-competent vaccinia virus, whereas jynneos™ is a replication-deficient modified vaccinia ankara virus. acam2000® shows some major cutaneous reactions, but jynneos™ does not show cutaneous reactions. under emergency use authorization, the aventis pasteur smallpox vaccine can be used, but its effectiveness against mpox is still unknown. the fda approved the use of the jynneos™ vaccine in 2019 to prevent smallpox and mpox. originally, the fda developed these vaccines for the subcutaneous route in a two-dose series. however, due to overwhelming demand, the fda issued an emergency use authorization on 9 august 2022 for the intradermal route in a two-dose series. it was also found that full vaccination with the vaccine through subcutaneous, intradermal, and heterologous routes had an adjusted ve of 88.9%, 80.3%, and 86.9%, respectively. these vaccines are administered to persons who are either suffering from mpox or have been previously exposed to such patients of mpox. these vaccines are also offered to persons who are at high risk of getting infected by mpox, such as gay, bisexual, msm, transgender, non-binary, or gender non-conforming persons and hiv patients. huber et al. have shown the effectiveness of the vaccine on patients suffering from mpox and others with msm, aged 18–49. a total of 309 infected patients were included in this study and found that the adjusted vaccine efficiency was 75.2% 61.2 to 84.2) in patients with a single dose of vaccine and 85.9% in patients with full vaccination. lauren pischel quantified the vaccine efficacy of third-generation mpox vaccines in preventing infection, hospitalization, and death among the global population. they compared vaccinated individuals to those unvaccinated or vaccinated with other vaccines. additionally, they analyzed vaccine efficacy based on the number of vaccine doses and whether the vaccine was administered as post-exposure prophylaxis. a comprehensive literature search yielded 11,892 initial records, with an additional 3223 identified through citation tracking. thirty-three studies focused on third-generation mpox vaccines, predominantly mva-bn. two additional studies reanalysed existing data. the majority of these studies cantered on gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men aged 18–49, conducted between may and october 2022. vaccine efficacy for a single dose of mva-bn was estimated at 76% across twelve studies. for two doses, the vaccine efficacy was calculated at 82% based on six studies. regarding post-exposure prophylaxis with mva-bn, the vaccine efficacy against mpox was 20% from seven studies. all vaccine efficacy estimates were derived from random-effects meta-analysis. in terms of study quality, 18 out of 33 were rated as poor, 3 out of 33 as fair, and 12 out of 33 as good. notably, studies included in the meta-analysis generally exhibited higher quality, with 11 out of 16 rated as good. 5.2. various therapies for the management of mpox 5.2.1. tecovirimat tecovirimat is generally used to treat smallpox, as recommended by the food and drug administration, but under the expanded access investigational new drug protocol, it can also be used to treat mpox. in the united states or canada, tecovirimat is not approved for use against mpox, although tecovirimat is now approved in europe for the treatment of mpox. various clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the efficacy of tecovirimat, but it is not clear. tecovirimat is a small molecule virus inhibitor with strong activity against mpox and other smallpox viruses. tecovirimat’s mechanism involves targeting the highly conserved orthopoxvirus f13l protein. this protein is essential for the creation of enveloped virions, which are necessary for viral spread
